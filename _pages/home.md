PHYS 3330, Electronics for the Physical Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder (commonly referred to as "Junior Lab") is a two credit course that provides an introduction to electronic design through hands-on experimentation. It is designed to be a rewarding, challenging, creative, and even fun experience. It will provide you with a deep introduction to electronics and to experiential design/modeling using electronics. You will be building electronic systems from scratch, then debugging them and demonstrating that you understand how they work. Modern physical measurements, communication, and computation rely on electronic hardware and instrumentation. Electronic instrumentation is used in all sub-fields of physics, including condensed matter, elementary particles, nuclear physics, and atomic/molecular/optical physics. Electronic measurements are no less common in the other physical sciences, and are essential in many modern interdisciplinary areas such as satellite-based environmental monitoring, the experimental study of chaos, nanotechnology, and even the search for extraterrestrial life.

The first 10 weeks of the course consists of five guided experiments. A short oral presentation or written report follows the completion of each of these five experiments. About mid-semester, students individually or in small teams begin to conceive of independent experimental research projects covering any field relevant to experimental physics. This project is the focus of weeks 11-15. The instructors make every effort to support original and creative projects. At the end of the semester, the student submits a written project report and also gives an oral presentation.

## Meeting Times and Information

**Lectures:** Lectures are on Tuesday and Thursday from 12:55 pm - 1:45 pm in Duane G125. The material includes theoretical background that you will need to do the experiments as well as discussions of lab skills. We will be using iClicker for interactive lecture questions and discussion. Lectures will not be recorded but the slides used will be [posted in Canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/).

**Lab Sessions:** Each section has one three-hour instructional lab session per week, supervised by your lab instructor. You must attend the weekly scheduled lab session that corresponds with the section you are enrolled in. 

- Section 102 - Tuesday from 2:00 pm to 4:50 pm
- Section 103 - Thursday from 9:00 am to 11:50 am
- Section 104 - Thursday from 2:00 pm to 4:50 pm

## Textbook and Reference Materials

There is no required textbook for this course but there are several great options for electronics textbooks you can reference available in the lab or library. Each lab writeup includes suggested readings from three different reference books: 

1. "**Analog and Digital Electronics**" by Steck is an online free textbook available [here](http://atomoptics-nas.uoregon.edu/~dsteck/teaching/electronics/electronics-notes.pdf). 
2. "**The Art of Electronics**", 2nd Edition, by Horowitz and Hill is the canonical reference book found on the bookshelves of physicists everywhere and several copies are available for reference in the lab. Note that the copies found in the lab, as well as the suggested readings in the lab guides, are for the second edition of this text. There exists an updated third edition, so be aware of this as you use this reference.
3. "**The Electronics Companion**" by A.C. Fischer-Cripps. Reference copies are available in the lab.

Additionally, we have a copy of "**Open Circuits: The Inner Beauty of Electronic Components**" by Windell Oskay and Eric Schlaepfer in the lab. This book "is a photographic exploration of the beautiful design inside everyday electronics. Its stunning cross-section photography unlocks a hidden world full of elegance, subtle complexity, and wonder." It's worth having a look to get some insight into how the electronic components we will be using in this course are manufactured.

## Group Work

Labs should be done in groups of two (sections with an odd number of students will require at least one student to work alone). You are responsible for finding your own lab partner. Groups larger than two are not permitted. You should work with your lab partner in setting up the circuits and taking the data, with both of you being equally involved. You are also allowed to work with your partner on the data analysis but each of you must do the data analysis, including making your own plots. You should not be sharing lab or Mathematica notebooks.

## Lab Organization

There are 10 student workstations, each consisting of a set of electronic measuring instruments. You will use the same workstation throughout the semester, but share it with students belonging to the other lab sections. Individual experiments, on the other hand, are built up on circuit boards that your team keeps for the entire semester. This allows you to continue to work on your circuit for as long as you need to complete the work. A course calendar showing the lab and lecture plan for the semester and other useful information is posted on Canvas. During the semester, announcements will be posted on the course on Canvas and, if needed, sent to you by e-mail. In accordance with University policy, you are required to maintain and regularly check an e-mail account. You are also encouraged to use e-mail to communicate with the instructors.

## Lab Availability and Use

The course will go much more smoothly (and quickly) for you if you are well prepared for each lab session so you can get most of the work done while your instructor is available to help. Remember to clean up your area when you are finished as the space is shared between all the lab sections. Your own circuit boards and other equipment should be left on your labeled shelf in one of the storage cabinets. Communal equipment, including meters, stop watches, tools from the bench, cables, etc. should be returned to their storage locations. The lab is open for unsupervised work any time the building wing is open, and when no other session is in progress. These times are available for you to complete unfinished experiments or to explore your own ideas. Your Buff One Card will open the lab door. Please do not prop open the lab door or the hallway barrier door: doing so will result in a warning and then loss of keycard access to the lab. If you are the last to leave the lab, please turn off all equipment, close any windows, turn off the lights, and make sure the door closes and latches when you leave the lab. 

## Broken and/or Malfunctioning Equipment

Lab equipment may fail, malfunction, or become damaged throughout the semester. If this happens, please report it to the lab technical staff by completing [this form](/PHYS-3330/report-lab-issue) and report it to you instructor or TA. The lab issue form allows you to also submit attachments which helps the technical staff identify and troubleshoot the issue.
