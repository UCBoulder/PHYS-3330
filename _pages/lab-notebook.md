# Lab Notebook Purpose

Record keeping is an essential part of the scientific process. The laboratory notebook is the primary medium for keeping these records - facilitating the recording of a range of different activities, crucial to doing effective science. First and foremost, **it serves as a record of precisely what one did (both successfully and unsuccessfully) during the course of one’s** **experiment**. It should be complete and designed to capture the goals of the experiment, the procedures/approaches used, the analysis and modeling of the experiment, the results and interpretation. By reading a lab notebook another scientist should be able to interpret what experiment was conducted, observe the data, and follow the analysis and findings. It should contain enough information such that another person could replicate the work. Furthermore, information in the notebook is essential to corroborating anything that ultimately ends up being published. **Effective record keeping practice is a skill that requires substantial time to cultivate to a point where your records will be suitable for a research lab, so it’s important to start developing this skill early.**

# Important Information to Record

There are a variety of different types of information that researcher’s use a lab notebook to keep track of during daily lab activities. This information goes beyond simply recording parameter values and data points. The majority of the information falls under one of the four following categories:

**Objective information:** This consists of the parameters, settings, and data that result from measurement, alignment, or any other concrete actions taken by the researcher. This type of information is what you may commonly think of as being present in scientific records. One might describe the objective information found in the notebook as the “facts” of the experiment.

**Subjective information:** This usually manifests as the researcher’s interpretation or evaluation of the events in lab and commonly accompanies the objective information from the experiment. Just because this information contains the opinion of the researcher does not mean that it is “unscientific”. For example, researchers spend a great deal of time troubleshooting and redesigning their experimental apparatus in an attempt to improve their measurements – by including subjective interpretation of various measurements (*e.g.* “these data looked unusual” or “it seems like the alignment is bad”) the researcher can better recall their impression of prior measurements, and thus are better able to put these in the context of their current understanding of the experiment.

**Analysis information:** It is common for analysis to be performed on raw data throughout the entire experimental process. Often, this is done in order to directly compare experimental results to theoretical models/predictions. Examples include short calculations and plots with accompanying fits to models. The information from this kind of analysis is often recorded in the notebook alongside the experimental details about the data, which aids the reader in interpreting the results.

**Planning information:** This consists of future plans or directions for the research. This information can entail both short term/incremental plans (e.g. taking more data, similar to previous measurements but with slightly different parameters) as well as long term/substantial plans (e.g. complete redesigns of experimental apparatus). Researchers are constantly reflecting on and re-conceptualizing the day-to-day outcomes of their experiments; therefore it can be difficult to keep track of new ideas and experimental directions unless they are written alongside other pertinent experimental information.

# Considerations When Recording Information

**Context:** Understanding the context of a lab notebook entry means understanding the “what” and the “why” of each experimental decision – in other words, “what was it that I measured and why did I measure it?” **It means understanding each entry in the broader picture of the entire experiment.** So, when recording information in your notebook consider if you are able to understand how what you’re writing pertains to the experiment as a whole. If you are simply writing down the numbers for each parameter and listing the different data that you’ve recorded without explaining the reasoning behind the measurements, it is likely you will be unable to make sense of what you’ve written later on.

**Audience:** You are the primary audience of your notebook, but authentic research is done collaboratively, therefore the lab records of an experiment must be available to all the researchers involved. This may include peers in the same research group, one’s advisor, or researchers from collaborating research groups. Thus, when writing in your notebook try to imagine how your writing may be interpreted by others. Keep in mind what things you infer or assume, without writing down, and ask yourself whether or not others may be able to make sense of the context of your entry without this information. **In the case of your lab class, your audience will also likely include your lab partner and your instructor.**

**Timescale:** You will find that you may need to reference various pieces of information recorded in your notebook in a week, a month, or in the case of authentic research potentially more than a year from when it was recorded. Of the information you write down, you will never know what you will need and when you will need it, but through experience you will find that some of the information maybe be of more short term importance (e.g. equipment parameters that will be updated in the subsequent few days) whereas other information you may keep coming back to over the course of weeks or months (e.g. a commonly reproduced alignment procedure). It is important to be mindful of this when writing each entry – it is good practice to ask yourself “When might I need this?” whenever writing down new information. **The farther in the future that may be, the more detail you should include.**

**Time investment:** The process of keeping lab records is a fine balance between writing enough detail so that your records will be useful in the future and doing so in a time efficient way that does not slow the progress of your experiment. Record keeping is a time intensive part of the experimental process – many researchers express that they feel they should be taking more time to write additional information in the lab records that they keep. Very few of them feel that they spend too much time adding detail to these records. **Do not look at record keeping as an afterthought to the actual experimental process, but rather as an integral part that will require substantial amounts of your lab time to get right.**

# Course Specific Information and Recommendations

The lab guides contain step-by-step instructions on how to set up your circuits, what data to take, and questions you are supposed to answer.

Tips on how to organize your lab notebook and lab report:

1. Each of the two lab partners should keep a separate lab notebook of their work in the lab, and each should submit their own lab report each week.

2. We typically recommend that students submit a separate report that includes a scanned copy of their lab notebook as an appendix to the report. In this case we will be grading the report, and just verifying that the notebook exists and is generally consistent with what is in the report.

3. The separate report and notebook is most important for students that choose to use a handwritten notebook (see the following section). For students that elect to utilize a fully electronic notebook that can be edited at will, it is typically not necessary to submit a separate report and notebook as they can act as one.

4. Spiral notebooks are available in the lab for you to use for your lab notebook, though many students prefer to use an electronic format of their own choosing, such as OneNote, Word, Mathematica, etc. The lab report also might be written by hand or done electronically, though all graphing should be done electronically. If written out by hand then you will make pdf scans and upload those to Canvas. While either is fine, please note that if your hand-writing is not very clear it will make it more challenging for us to read your lab notebooks, and if we have any doubts of the content it will affect your grade. For those using an electronic format it is also easier to upgrade discussions of earlier portions of the lab, as you continue to learn the material.

5. At the start of your lab report (or notebook if you end up only submitting your notebook) write a 2-3 sentence summary explaining what the main point of the lab is, i.e. what the goal is and summarize what steps will be taken to reach this goal.

6. For each step, write down the section number from the lab guide, draw the circuit diagram, and if any changes have been made to the circuit compared to the prior step. It’s better to overdo it than underdo it here. It should be possible to replicate your circuit based only on what you have in your notebook (i.e. without looking at the lab guide). Points will be deducted if one has to look at the lab manual to figure what you did including the circuit diagrams.

7. Then do the measurements and record your results, usually in the form of a table, including comments about any aspects that concerned you, for example excess noise or related.

8. Make plots of your data as needed using Mathematica (preferably) or another program of your choice, including a comparison to the theoretical expectations from your prelab, as you are doing the lab. Ideally, we suggest including plots into the lab notebook, not just into the report. We strongly advise against putting off making plots for later, because these plots will tell you if the data you took were OK or may be there was something wrong with the measurement. For example, if you are measuring a voltage response as a function of frequency, you may wish to take extra data points around a special frequency, or you may notice that the noise at very high or low frequencies was hiding the expected behavior. The only way to see that often is if you make a plot and compare it in detail to the expected theoretical behavior (which you can also update based upon the new understanding you gained from doing the lab).

9. All plots in the submitted report or notebook must be made so that the axes are labeled, correct units should be included on the labels, and the ranges (mins and maxes) of the axes should be close to the mins and maxes of the data. Log plots will be necessary for many of the datasets, so you should select log vs. linear axes as needed. Fonts should be large enough to be legible without having to zoom in. Each plot should also have a brief caption describing what is in the plot. (e.g. Current vs. voltage measured across the resistor 5 in circuit diagram #4).

10. Don’t forget to answer any questions asked in the lab manual using complete sentences so that it is not necessary to look at the manual to find out what question you are answering. 

    ​	i.e.

    ​	Wrong – 5 Amps

    ​	Right – Current through resistor 5 in circuit diagram #6 is 5 Amps.


11. If you later realize that your DATA are wrong for whatever reason (e.g. you made a mistake in the circuit) you can redo this part of the lab later and just state which item # you are redoing and just follow the above instructions. No points will be taken off for the original incorrect entries.

12. All labs will be worth 40 points. A grade of 36 will correspond to doing everything properly, with no obvious mistakes. Grades above 36 will be reserved for submissions that go "above and beyond", i.e. especially high accuracy data, clear arguments, or discussions. There might for example be subtleties in some of the questions or results that might be explained better by some students than others, so we will reserve the highest grade for the most accurate data and discussions, even if others aren’t necessarily “wrong”.

**You are encouraged to ask your instructor for help with the notebooks and reports. We will be happy to point out how to improve before the report is turned in.**

# Examples

[Here](resources/lab-notebook/Lab-Notebook-Examples.pdf) we present some examples of notebook records taken from a physics research lab here at CU Boulder. The various entries are recorded by several different researchers who are working collaboratively on the project. You will notice that each researcher has a different style and format to their entry, but much of the same information and thought process can be seen in each entry. These excerpts are meant as examples of authentic scientific record keeping and **do not represent a definitive illustration** for how you should maintain your records.
