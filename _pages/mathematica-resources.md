# Mathematica Resources

- An introduction to Mathematica is given in [Lab Skill Activity - Mathematica Introduction](/PHYS-3330/lab-guides/lsa1)
- Making nice plots and fitting with Mathematica is provided in [Lab Skill Activity - Analyzing Data in Mathematica](/PHYS-3330/lab-guides/lsa2)
- Plotting data and theory together is shown in this [Mathematica plotting handout](resources/mathematica-resources/Mathematica_Plotting_handout.pdf)
- Adding error bars to your data points is shown in this [plotting with error bars handout](resources/mathematica-resources/Plotting-with-error-bars.pdf)
- A quick way to add data into Mathematica is shown in this [Introduction to Realtime Data Entry](resources/mathematica-resources/Realtime_data_entry_into_Mathematica.nb) Mathematica notebook
- You can learn how to fit your data with Mathematica using the this [Muon Lifetime with Fitting](resources/mathematica-resources/MuonLifetimeWithFitting.nb) Mathematica notebook along with the [Fit Function](resources/mathematica-resources/FitFunction.nb) Mathematica notebook and [this sample data](resources/mathematica-resources/goodmuon2.txt)
