# Installing the Updated Windows Version of LTSpice on macOS via Wine (Experimental)

**Disclaimer:** Please be aware that using Wine to run Windows applications on macOS can introduce instability and potential bugs. This method is considered experimental and may not provide a flawless experience. Use with caution.

**Introduction:**

This document outlines the steps to install the Windows version of LTSpice on macOS using Wine. This allows you to run the updated version of LTSpice even if you don't have a Windows machine available.

**Prerequisites:**

- macOS (tested on Sequoia 15.3 with Apple Silicon (M3))
- Internet connection

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Install Homebrew:**
   - Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software.
   - Download and install Homebrew from the official website: [https://brew.sh/ ](https://brew.sh/)
   - Follow the instructions on the website to complete the installation. (This was tested with the .pkg installation method.)
   - **Add Brew to Path:**
     - After installing Brew, you may need to add it to your system's PATH variable.
     - Refer to this Stack Overflow answer for guidance: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/70575716](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70575716)

2. **Install Wine:**

   - Wine is a compatibility layer that allows you to run Windows applications on macOS.

   - Open Terminal and execute the following command:

   - ```Bash
     brew install --cask --no-quarantine wine-stable
     ```

3. **Rosetta 2 (Potentially Required):**

   - During the wine installation, you may receive a message indicating that Rosetta 2 is required.

   - If you receive this message, you may need to run the following command. However, this was not run on our testing installation, so we recommend not running it at first and see if things work for you.

   - ```Bash
     softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
     ```

4. **Install GStreamer Framework:**

   - GStreamer is a multimedia framework that may be required by Wine.

   - Open Terminal and execute the following command:

   - ```Bash
     brew install --cask gstreamer-development
     ```

5. **Download LTSpice for Windows:**
   - Visit the Analog Devices website to download the Windows version of LTSpice: [https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html)
   - Download the .msi installer file (e.g., LTspice64.msi). In our testing, v24.1.4 was used.

6. **Install LTSpice via Wine:**

   - Open Terminal.

   - Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the LTSpice installer.

   - Execute the following command to install LTSpice:

   - ```Bash 
     wine msiexec /i LTspice64.msi
     ```

   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Use the default install location.

7. **Run LTSpice:**

   - To run LTSpice, open Terminal and execute the following command:

   - ```Bash
     wine users/YOUR_USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/ADI/LTspice/LTspice.exe
     ```

   - Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your macOS username.
   - You may want to create an alias or script to simplify launching LTSpice.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Stability:** Running Windows applications via Wine can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.
- **Compatibility:** Not all features of LTSpice may function correctly under Wine.
- **Updates:** Updates to macOS, Wine, or LTSpice may break this installation.
- **Troubleshooting:** If you experience issues, consult the Wine documentation and community forums.

**Disclaimer Reminder:**

This installation method is provided for informational purposes only. Use it at your own risk. Be prepared for potential issues and consider using the native macOS LTSpice installation.
