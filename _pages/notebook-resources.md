# Mathematica Notebooks



# Jupyter Notebooks

There are many ways that you can go about creating Jupyter notebooks. The [Jupyter project](https://jupyter.org/) supports over 40 programming languages, but our focus here will be Python. A popular method of using Jupyter notebooks is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). This comes pre-packaged with many additional Python packages as well (which also means it's a large install). We will discuss a few other options below.
