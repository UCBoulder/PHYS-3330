# Soldering Resources

While soldering is not an explicit exercise included in this course, you may find that as you work through your labs (and quite possibly on your final project), you will need to solder some components. Your instructors and TA's should be valuable resources for information on how to do this. Additionally, we've included some other resources that you may find useful.
