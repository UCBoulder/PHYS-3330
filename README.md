# Electronics Lab Website for CU Boulder Physics

The website is built off of the main branch. 

To contribute to the site, you should make a branch. You can then work/commit to your new branch. When finished, create a pull request for review.

When you commit, please create helpful messages/descriptions (i.e. "Update Lab1 Prelab").

Since GitHub pages will only build off of the main branch, you will need to test the website locally. This can be done by following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) guide. 

## Editing Lab Guides

The "raw" lab guide markdown files are located in the `raw-content` directory. Jekyll is configured to ignore this directory, as there are additional steps required to generate the content for the site (discussed below). The files in the `raw-content` directory are what should be edited (not the html files in the `_includes` directory). 

The html files in the `_includes` directory are generated by running the `raw-content\mdtohtml.ps1` script. This script requires pandoc and pandoc-xnos to be installed on your system in order to run.

## New Lab Guide Development

The lab guide files, `raw-content\labX-raw.md,` $X=1,2,...,10$, are the "live" guides that are linked to on the website. So don't edit these unless we need to make a typo change, etc. For new lab guides (or for developing new versions), follow the "old/new" naming convention that currently exists.
