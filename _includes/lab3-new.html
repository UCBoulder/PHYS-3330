         <p>In this lab, you will characterize the frequency dependence
         of three passive filters. You will gain more experience
         modeling circuits, comparing those models to experiment, and
         modeling the effects of measurement tools.</p>
         <p>You will learn to use new equipment and devices</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Oscilloscope probe</p></li>
         <li><p>Capacitors and inductors</p></li>
         <li><p>LCR meter</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>You will learn to model</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>the frequency dependence and effects on phase of passive
         filters</p></li>
         <li><p>scope measurements to include the capacitance of the
         coax cable</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>You will also learn how to refine the oscilloscope
         measurement to reduce the effect of coax capacitance.</p>
         <p>A frequent problem in physical experiments is to detect an
         electronic signal when it is hidden in a background of noise
         and unwanted signals. The process of removing background
         frequencies and preserving a desired frequency is known as
         <strong><em>filtering</em></strong>. The signal of interest may
         be at a particular frequency, as in an NMR (nuclear magnetic
         resonance) experiment, or it may be an electrical pulse, as
         from a single photon detector. The background generally
         contains thermal noise from the transducer and amplifier, pick
         up of the 60 Hz wall power, transients from machinery,
         radiation from radio and TV stations, cell phone radiation, and
         so forth. The purpose of filtering is to enhance the signal of
         interest by recognizing its characteristic time dependence and
         to reduce the unwanted background to the lowest possible level.
         A radio does this when you tune to a particular station, using
         a resonant circuit to only allow a narrow band of frequency
         through (the center frequency of this band is <em>the
         station</em>). The signal you want may be less than <span
         class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\)</span> of the total radiation
         power at your antenna, yet you get a high-quality signal from
         the selected station due to the filtering. Many experiments
         require specific filters designed so that the signal from the
         phenomenon of interest lies in the pass-band of the filter,
         while the attenuation bands are chosen to suppress the
         background and noise.</p>
         <p>The prelab and lab activities this week introduce you to the
         filtering properties of some widely used but simple circuits,
         employing only a resistor and capacitor for high- and low-pass
         filters and an LCR (inductor, capacitor, resistor) circuit for
         a band-pass filter.</p>
         <h1 data-number="2" id="definitions"><span
         class="header-section-number">2</span> Definitions</h1>
         <p><strong>Scope probe</strong> - a test probe used to increase
         the resistive impedance and lower the capacitive impedance
         compared to a simple coax cable probe.</p>
         <p><strong>Transfer function</strong> - the complex function
         <span class="math inline">\(V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Gain</strong> - the magnitude of the transfer
         function is the voltage gain <span
         class="math inline">\(G=|T|=|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>. The
         power gain is the square of this: <span
         class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|^2\)</span>. If the gain
         is not specified, you can assume it is the voltage (or
         amplitude) gain.</p>
         <p><strong>Decibel (dB)</strong> - a measure of the power
         transmitted by converting the power gain (or voltage gain) to a
         logarithmic scale. The difference in power between output and
         input in decibels (dB) is <span
         class="math inline">\(10~log_{10}~|V_{out}/V_{in}|^2
         =20~log_{10}~|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>. One common reference
         point is where the ratio of output to input power is 1/2, which
         is <span class="math inline">\(10~log_{10}(0.5) =
         -3~dB\)</span>. This corresponds to <span
         class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}| = 1/\sqrt 2 = 0.707 =
         70.7\%\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Pass band</strong> - the range of frequencies that
         can pass through a filter without being attenuated.</p>
         <p><strong>Attenuation band</strong> - the range of frequencies
         where the filter attenuates the signal.</p>
         <p><strong>Half power point</strong> or <strong>cutoff
         frequency</strong> or <strong>corner frequency</strong> or
         <strong>3 dB frequency, <span
         class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span></strong> - frequency
         separating the pass and attenuation bands. It is the frequency
         at the half-power <span class="math inline">\((-3\text{
         dB})\)</span> point, where the <em>power</em> transmitted is
         half the maximum power transmitted. The output voltage
         <em>amplitude</em> at <span class="math inline">\(f =
         f_0\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
         = 70.7\%\)</span> of the maximum amplitude.</p>
         <p><strong>Low-pass filter</strong> - a filter that passes low
         frequency signals and attenuates (reduces the amplitude of)
         signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Also
         known as an integrator.</p>
         <p><strong>High-pass filter</strong> - a filter that passes
         high frequency signals and attenuates (reduces the amplitude
         of) signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency.
         Also known as a differentiator.</p>
         <p><strong>Band-pass filter</strong> - passes frequencies
         within a certain range and attenuates frequencies outside that
         range.</p>
         <p><strong>Band-pass filter bandwidth</strong> - the range of
         frequencies between the upper (<span
         class="math inline">\(f_+\)</span>) and lower (<span
         class="math inline">\(f_-\)</span>) half power (3dB) points:
         <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f = f_+ - f_-\)</span>.</p>

         <p>Capacitors and inductors have imaginary impedances. When
         these elements are used in voltage divider arrangements, this
         will lead to transfer functions that are complex functions
         (they have real and imaginary parts). When dealing with complex
         transfer functions, it much simpler to represent sinusoidal
         functions as complex exponentials:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[e^{j\omega t} = \cos{\omega t}
         + j \sin{\omega t}\]</span></p>
         <p><em>Note:</em> in the context of electrical engineering and
         circuits, we use <span
         class="math inline">\(j=\sqrt{-1}\)</span> to avoid confusion
         with <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> potentially
         representing a current.</p>
         <p>Therefore for a sine-wave input with amplitude <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{0}\)</span> and angular frequency
         <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, we can write the
         input as</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{in}(t) = V_0e^{j\omega
         t}\]</span></p>
         <p>Applying any transfer function <span
         class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to this input will lead to the
         following output</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out}(t) =
         TV_\text{in}(t) = V_0 T e^{j\omega t}\]</span>
         {#eq:complex-transfer}</p>
         <p>When <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a complex
         function, it is far easier to multiply it and the complex
         exponential when <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is put
         into its “magnitude and phase” form</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[T = |T|e^{j\delta}\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(|T|\)</span> is the
         magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the phase of <span
         class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in the complex plane.</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[|T| = \sqrt{TT^*} =
         \sqrt{\text{Re}[T]^2 + \text{Im}[T]^2}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\tan\delta =
         \frac{\text{Im}[T]}{\text{Re}[T]}\]</span></p>
         <p>In this form, Equation ?? becomes</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = |T|V_0e^{j\omega
         t + \delta}\]</span></p>
         <p>So the magnitude of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>
         scales the amplitude of <span

         <p>A capacitor is an object that stores energy in the form of
         electric fields (between two metal objects) when a voltage
         difference is applied. The capacitance is defined as the ratio
         of the induced charge (on the two metal objects) to the voltage
         applied; i.e.</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Q = C\ \Delta V\]</span></p>
         <p>Capacitance is purely determined by the geometry of the
         pieces of metal that are separated. You may remember that for
         parallel plates of area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
         separated by distance <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>,
         the capacitance is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[C = \varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0
         \frac{A}{d}\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_r\)</span> is
         the relative dielectric constant of whatever material is
         between the plates.</p>
         <p>With regards to Ohm’s law <span
         class="math inline">\((\Delta V=IZ)\)</span>, the impedance of
         a capacitor is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Z_C = \frac{1}{j\omega

         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> is the
         angular frequency (in radians per second) and is related to the
         frequency (in Hertz) by</p>

         <p>Angular frequency <span

         However, experimentally, you will be working with cycle

         are a pair of wires (sometimes twisted into a “twisted pair”)

         voltage difference between the conductor carrying current to

         <p>For a coax cable, we can use Gauss’s Law to determine the
         electric field between the conductors. Drawing a Gaussian
         cylinder co-axial to the cable and between the conductors <span
         class="math inline">\((a&lt;r&lt;b)\)</span> will enclose the
         charge on the inner conductor. However, if you take the radius
         of the Gaussian cylinder to be greater than the whole cable
         <span class="math inline">\((r&gt;b)\)</span>, then the charge
         on the outer conductor will cancel the charge on the inner
         conductor, so there is <strong>no</strong> field outside the
         cable (one of the advantages of this cable construction). If
         our Gaussian cylinder has radius <span
         class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and length <span
         class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, then the surface area of
         the wall is <span class="math inline">\(2\pi r\ell\)</span>.
         The charge enclosed then would be <span
         class="math inline">\(2\pi a \ell\sigma\)</span> (where <span
         class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the surface charge
         density), so Gauss’s law says</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\int\mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{A}
         =
         \frac{\rho_\text{enclosed}}{\varepsilon_r\varepsilon_0}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[2\pi E r\ell = \frac{2\pi

         <p><span class="math display">\[\mathbf{E} =
         \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_r
         \varepsilon_0}\frac{a}{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}}\]</span></p>
         <p>We can relate this to the voltage by integrating from <span
         class="math inline">\(r=b\)</span> (where the voltage is held
         at ground) to <span class="math inline">\(r=a\)</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\Delta V = -\int_b^a
         \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{r}&#39; = -\frac{\sigma
         a}{\varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0} \int_b^a\frac{dr}{r} =
         \frac{\sigma a}{\varepsilon_r
         \varepsilon_0}\ln\bigg(\frac{b}{a}\bigg)\]</span></p>
         <p>The capacitance can then be found by dividing the charge by

         <p>The inductor is an element that stores energy in the form of
         magnetic fields when current is passed through them. Any

         self generates, so all circuits have some amount of inductance
         (which is often ignored). When the current changes, naturally
         the strength of the self-induced magnetic field through the
         loop changes. Faraday’s law states that this will create a back
         EMF (electromagnetic force). This can be written as a voltage

         <p>Decibels is a “relative unit of measurement.” In
         electronics, decibels are meant to describe how the power
         changes (sort of like a transfer function). You can calculate
         decibels with the following equation:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[ 10\log_{10}
         \bigg[\frac{P_\text{out}}{P_\text{in}}\bigg]\text{
         dB}\]</span></p>
         <p>When you have negative decibels, it means the something is
         attenuated (gets smaller), and, when positive, it means that
         something has gain (gets larger)</p>
         <p>Calculate the decibels for when the power is cut in half.
         Does it make sense that the half power point is also called the
         3 dB point?</p>

         <p>The cutoff frequency of these filters is related to the
         RC-time (resistance times capacitance has units of time) of the
         circuit: <span class="math inline">\(f_0 = 1/(2\pi
         RC)\)</span>. This means that the cutoff frequency can be
         determined by measuring the RC-time constant related to the
         charging and discharging of the capacitor. For the low-pass
         filter, this can be done by applying a voltage long enough to
         fully charge the capacitor to the input voltage (i.e. when
         <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}=V_\text{out}\)</span>),
         and then turning off the voltage to allow the capacitor to
         discharge. This discharge will be an exponential decay over
         time</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out}(t) =

         class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Quality factor</h2>
         <p>For a low-pass and high-pass filter, the bandwidth can be
         described simply by the cutoff frequency. For a low-pass, the
         bandwidth is <span class="math inline">\(0\text{ Hz} -
         f_c\)</span> and for the high-pass filter, the bandwidth is
         <span class="math inline">\(f_c-\infty\text{ Hz}\)</span>. The
         band-pass filter however, has two cutoff frequencies, one
         above, and one below the center frequency. The bandwidth is
         then</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\Delta f = f_{0_+} -
         f_{0_-}\]</span></p>
         <p>However, this bandwidth is usually represented as a
         dimensionless quantity called the <em>quality factor</em> <span
         class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> which is the center frequency
         divided by the bandwidth:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[Q = \frac{f_c}{\Delta
         f}\]</span></p>
         <p>A <em>quality factor</em> in general, is a property of any
         resonator (oscillator). Our LCR band-pass filter is a resonator
         (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4q7mIhLrY">here’s a
         nice, short video explanation</a>): the capacitor and inductor
         exchange electric field energy (in the capacitor) for magnetic
         field energy (in the inductor) with a frequency of <span
         class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span> (the center frequency).</p>
         <p>In the context of the bandpass filter, the <em>quality
         factor</em> defines how “sharp” the filter is. The higher the
         <em>quality factor</em>, the smaller the bandwidth around the
         center frequency is. Conversely, the smaller the <em>quality
         factor</em>, the wider the bandwidth.</p>
         <p>The two cut off frequencies can be found by setting the
         magnitude of the transfer function to the -3 dB ratio: <span
         class="math inline">\((1/\sqrt{2})\)</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\omega
         L}{\sqrt{(R-\omega^2 LRC)^2+(\omega L)^2}} =

         <p>During the lab section, you will enter your measurements
         into your Mathematica or Jupyter notebook and plot them with
         your model predictions. To prepare for this, create a list of
         “fake data” and plot it on your Bode plots. This will allow you
         to compare your model and measurements in real time avoiding
         lost time taking lots of data when something is wrong with your

         <p>Both C-like and Fortran-like data have their pros and cons,
         but Fortran-like is far more common when working with
         experimental data because of how simply it translates to and
         from saved data in the form of data files where the types of
         data are separated by columns (left to right) and data points
         are stored in successive rows (top to bottom). Ultimately it is
         up to you to determine your own workflows and preferences, so
         we’ll leave this up to you to decide.</p>
