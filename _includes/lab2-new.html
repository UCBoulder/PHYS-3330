         class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Breadboard</h2>
         <p>Before modern prototyping boards, people would take wooden
         cutting boards (aka breadboards) and tack nails into them to
         provide scaffolding for testing circuits. <a
         href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/history">Take
         a look!</a> Modern prototyping boards are far more
         sophisticated but are affectionately still called
         breadboards.</p>
         <p>Breadboards allow you to quickly create and modify circuits
         without needing to solder anything. Once the circuit works and
         meets the desired specifications, a printed circuit board (PCB)
         can be designed and made. All the components can be soldered to
         the PCB and the circuit can be mounted in a metal case to
         shield it from external electromagnetic fields. Present
         technology allows anyone to cheaply design, layout, and print
         professional circuit boards. For example: <a

         <p>Breadboards are composed of several holes that you can stick
         wires into. The holes form rows of metallic connection (as seen
         in Figure <span class="citation"
         data-cites="fig:breadpins">@fig:breadpins</span>). Each of
         these rows are constructed like little grabbers that allow for
         secure connections (as seen in Figure <span class="citation"

         <p>Our breadboards have custom built headers (see Figure <span

         data-cites="fig:breadheader">@fig:breadheader</span>) to allow
         you to easily interface your equipment (scope, power supply,
         function generator, etc.) with the breadboard. All the
         connectors, switches, and potentiometers are connected to the
         green screw terminals that wires can be clamped in to connect
         to the breadboard.</p>

         <p>The far left and far right screw terminals are connected to

         ports, and the mid-right screw terminal is connected to the
         inner conductors of BNC ports.</p>

         connections to your protoboard</h3>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Many circuits require DC power connections (+15 V, -15V,
         ground). Connect the power supply to the interface panel using
         banana cables.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>USE A COLOR CODE FOR THE POWER
         CONNECTIONS!</strong> The convention used in this course is
         <strong>black = ground</strong>, <span
         style="color: red;"><strong>red = +15 V</strong></span>, and
         <span style="color: blue;"><strong>blue = -15
         V</strong></span>. Using a consistent color code will allow you
         and others to debug your circuits quickly. You are also less
         likely to plug something in incorrectly and burn up a
         component. You should also have a white colored banana jack on
         your interface panel. You may find that this is useful during
         your final project phase if you require another voltage.
         Remember to write down your color code in your lab
         notebook.</p></li>
         <li><p>Once you have power connected to the interface panel,
         use jumper wires from the appropriate screw terminal to make
         connections to the breadboard (+15, -15, and ground). The long
         rails that run the length of the board are best for
         distributing power to all of your components. <strong>Use these
         for only DC power or ground.</strong></p></li>
         <li><p>Good electrical contact is essential when you plug in
         components or wires. Use only 22- or 24-gauge solid wire, not
         stranded wire. The 22- or 24-gauge wire should make a good
         connection with the conductors inside the board without
         slipping out easily. Push in each wire until you feel the
         contacts grip. <strong>Don’t force larger wires into the
         protoboard. You can damage the connectors.</strong></p></li>
         <li><p>Reliable ground connections (0 V), readily accessible
         from any point on the breadboard, are essential to the good
         functioning of most circuits. The interface panel is wired such
         that outer conductor on the BNC connectors are connected to the
         <strong>black</strong> banana jack, which forces a common
         chassis ground. This is indicated on the wiring diagram printed
         on the interface panel.</p></li>

         EVERY TIME we use the function generator in this class. This
         does not change the output impedance of the function generator:

         but by default, it <em>assumes</em> you are impedance matching

         (you worked out why this might be important to do in the

         <li><p>Write an expression for the transfer function for the

         <li><p>Set up the function generator and the oscilloscope so
         that you can read Channel 1 from the function generator with
         Channel 1 of the oscilloscope (use a BNC T-connector so that
         later you can eventually connect this to your breadboard as

         </ol></li>
         <li><p>When you measure the voltage without the speaker, there

         the function generator. In this case, we are measuring the
         internal, source voltage (<span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> of our voltage
         divider model). When you apply the speaker, current flows and
         voltage drops across the output impedance, so that the full
         voltage doesn’t reach the load (<span

         <p>Since neither the impedance of the speaker nor the output
         impedance of the function generator can be changed, in order to
         get more power to the speaker, you will have to design more
         circuitry to deliver the signal in a way that draws little to
         no current from the function generator. In Lab 4, you will
         learn to build a voltage buffer circuit that does just

         little power is dissipated in the supply. What is the output
         resistance of the circuit (including your power supply and
         external components) if it produces 10V? Would this circuit be
         good for creating a variable voltage source in the range of
         5-10 V? HINT: Consider the power dissipated in the source.
         Explain using your diagram, model, and values of
         resistance.</p></li>

         A: Calibrating the 10-turn Potentiometer (If Needed)</h1>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The potentiometer on the circuit board panel has three
         connections. Two of the connections are at opposite end of a
         resistor. The third connection is connected to a sliding
         "wiper."</p></li>
         <li><p>Your potentiometer is actually a very precise device!
         You can control the intermediate resistances at the level of
         0.1% with a little care. To understand how, examine the dial on
         the potentiometer. It should have a window with a number in it,
         and a dial marked with a scale that goes from 00 to 99. The
         digit in the window increments with each full turn of the dial,
         so it represents the most significant digit of the setting
         number: if it says 3 in the window and the dial reads 55, then
         the setting is 355. For a 10-turn potentiometer such as yours,
         the dial should be able to run from 000 to 1000 by turning the
         knob ten full turns.</p></li>
         <li><p>First, check if your pot is already calibrated! Turn the
         knob counterclockwise until it stops. If the dial reads 000 in
         this position, your pot is calibrated.</p></li>
         <li><p>If the dial reads something other than 000 in this
         position, do the following procedure:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Use a 0.050” Allen key to loosen the small set-screw on
         the side of the knob.</p></li>
         <li><p>Pull the entire dial off the panel.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn the inner knob that remains on your panel
         counterclockwise until it stops.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn the now-detached knob until the dial reads
         000.</p></li>
         <li><p>Lock the dial by depressing the black switch on knob
         (and verify that the dial still reads 000).</p></li>
         <li><p>Push the dial back onto the inner knob, rotating the
         outside of the dial <strong>counterclockwise</strong> until it
         snaps in place against the panel and wont rotate. The dial
         should still read 000. If it doesnt, repeat the last three
         steps.</p></li>
         <li><p>Use the Allen key to tighten the set screw. Check the
         calibration again: the knob should stop at 000 and
         1000.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
