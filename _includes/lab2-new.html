         <p>Answer the following questions in your lab notebook and with
         Jupyter Notebooks. Scan the relevant pages and upload the PDF
         file to Canvas. Note that the lab prep activities are directly
         related to the lab and by completing them (and having them
         available during lab) you will be able to work through the lab
         more efficiently and be able to understand what you are doing
         during the lab.</p>
         <p>For your calculations, you should write a reusable function
         in a Python script that you can import into your Jupyter
         Notebooks. This will allow you to easily update calculations
         and recycle code in a practical way.</p>

         <p>Before modern prototyping boards, to test circuits, people
         would take wooden cutting boards (aka breadboards) and tack
         nails into them to provide scaffolding to create a circuit. <a
         href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/history">Take
         a look!</a> Even though we’ve moved to far more sophisticated
         prototyping boards, we still affectionately call them
         breadboards.</p>
         <p>Breadboards allow for quickly creating and modifying
         circuits, with no soldering. Once the circuit works and meets
         the desired specifications, a printed circuit board (PCB) can
         be designed and made. All the components can be soldered to the
         PCB and the circuit can be mounted in a metal case to shield it
         from external electromagnetic fields. Present technology allows
         anyone to cheaply design, layout, and print professional
         circuit boards. For example: <a

         <p>Breadboards are composed of several holes that you can stick
         wires into. The holes form rows of metallic connection (as seen
         in Figure ??). Each of these rows are constructed like little

         ??).</p>

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Many circuits require DC power connections (+15 V, -15V,
         ground). Connect the power supply to the interface panel using
         banana cables.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>USE A COLOR CODE FOR THE POWER
         CONNECTIONS!</strong> The convention used in this course is
         <strong>black = ground</strong>, <span
         style="color: red;"><strong>red = +15 V</strong></span>, and
         <span style="color: blue;"><strong>blue = -15
         V</strong></span>. Using a consistent color code will allow you
         and others to debug your circuits quickly. You are also less
         likely to plug something in incorrectly and burn up a
         component. You should also have a white colored banana jack on
         your interface panel. You may find that this is useful during
         your final project phase if you require another voltage.
         Remember to write down your color code in your lab
         notebook.</p></li>
         <li><p>Once you have power connected to the interface panel,
         use jumper wires from the appropriate screw terminal to make
         connections to the breadboard (+15, -15, and ground). The long
         rails that run the length of the board are best for
         distributing power to all of your components. <strong>Use these
         for only DC power or ground.</strong></p></li>
         <li><p>Good electrical contact is essential when you plug in
         components or wires. Use only 22- or 24-gauge solid wire, not
         stranded wire. The 22- or 24-gauge wire should make a good
         connection with the conductors inside the board without
         slipping out easily. Push in each wire until you feel the
         contacts grip. <strong>Don’t force larger wires into the
         protoboard. You can damage the connectors.</strong></p></li>
         <li><p>Reliable ground connections (0 V), readily accessible
         from any point on the breadboard, are essential to the good
         functioning of most circuits. The interface panel is wired such
         that outer conductor on the BNC connectors are connected to the
         <strong>black</strong> banana jack, which forces a common
         chassis ground. This is indicated on the wiring diagram printed
         on the interface panel.</p></li>

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Build a voltage divider similar to the one shown in
         Figure <a href="#fig:ideal-vd">4</a> using resistors of around
         <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ k}\Omega\)</span>. Draw a
         diagram of the circuit in your lab notebook. Make sure to label
         the resistors and record all measured component values and
         voltages.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure each resistor with your DMM before inserting it
         into your circuit and record the value. Why should you measure
         component values before placing them in the circuit?</p></li>
         <li><p>Predict the output voltage you should measure based on
         your input voltage and resistance measurements. Include your
         calculations and numerical predictions in your lab
         notebook.</p></li>
         <li><p>Now, apply a DC voltage to the input and measure the
         output voltage of your divider, first using your DMM and second
         using your oscilloscope with the mini-grabbers. Record your
         measurements. <em>Do not have the DMM and the oscilloscope
         connected at the same time because each may perturb the

         <li><p>Compare the voltages you predicted to the voltages you
         measured. Does your model of the voltage divider agree with
         each of your measurements? Explicitly record what criteria you
         used to determine whether or not the model and measurements
         agreed.</p></li>
         <li><p><em>Complete this step only if your model and
         measurements did not agree.</em> If your model and measurements
         did not agree, you will have to either refine your model or
         your experiment. Lets start by refining your model. Consider
         the input resistance of your measurement device. Draw a circuit
         diagram that includes that resistance. <em>HINT: See Figure <a
         href="#fig:modified-vd">6</a></em>. Derive an expression for
         the output voltage now including the unknown measurement device
         resistance. Use this new model to determine the input
         resistance of measurement device. (that is, rearrange your
         equation to solve for <span

         <li><p>Using your refined model, you have determined the input

         Dividers (Output Impedance)</h2>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Remember last week when we set the function generator to
         an output termination of <em>High Z</em>? We want to do this
         EVERY TIME we use the function generator in this class. This
         does not change the output impedance of the function generator:
         it’s ALWAYS <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>,
         but by default, it <em>assumes</em> you are impedance matching
         everything with <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>
         (you worked out why this might be important to do in the
         prelab). Turn on your function generator and set it to <em>High
         Z</em>. If you don’t remember how to change this setting, refer
         to Appendix B in Lab 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>Write an expression for the transfer function for the
         amount of the source voltage should actually be applied to the
         load.</p></li>
         <li><p>Grab a speaker (this will be your load) and use your DMM
         to measure the resistance of the speaker. On your diagram label
         the resistances of the output impedance of the function
         generator (<span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>) and
         the impedance of your speaker.</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up the function generator and the oscilloscope.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Set up the function generator and the oscilloscope so
         that you can read Channel 1 from the function generator with
         Channel 1 of the oscilloscope (use a BNC T-connector so that
         later you can eventually connect this to your breadboard as
         well).</p></li>
         <li><p>Connect the <em>Sync</em> on the function generator with
         Channel 4 of the oscilloscope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Create a <span class="math inline">\(2\
         \text{V}_\text{pp}\)</span> sine wave with a <span
         class="math inline">\(261.63\ \text{Hz}\)</span> frequency and
         trigger on the <em>Sync</em> (in the trigger menu, change the
         channel to Channel 4). This will provide a nice lower frequency
         tone (a <span class="math inline">\(\text{C}_4\)</span> note)
         at a volume that won’t be too obnoxious to your
         neighbors.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>Confirm on the oscilloscope that the frequency and the
         amplitude of your wave match the settings on the function
         generator (measure them).</p></li>
         <li><p>Apply the signal from the function generator to the
         speaker (use the T-connector, so you can still see it on the
         oscilloscope). You can use mini grabbers to connect to the two
         ends of the speaker.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Now what is the amplitude of the sine wave on Channel 1
         of the oscilliscope?</p></li>
         <li><p>Why did the amplitude change after applying the load to
         the function generator’s output? Disconnect the speaker: did
         the amplitude recover? Why? Reconnect the function generator to
         your circuit and confirm the voltage changes.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>When you measure the voltage without the speaker, there
         is (virtually) no current, so no voltage drops across the <span
         class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> output impedance of
         the function generator. In this case, we are measuring the
         internal, source voltage (<span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> of our voltage
         divider model). When you apply the speaker, current flows and
         voltage drops across the output impedance, so that the full
         voltage doesn’t reach the load (<span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> in our voltage
         divider model). Using both measurements calculate the transfer
         function.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>Since neither the impedance of the speaker nor the output
         impedance of the function generator can be changed, in order to
         get more power to the speaker, you will have to design more
         circuitry to deliver the signal in a way that draws little to
         no current from the function generator. In Lab 4, you will
         learn to build a voltage buffer circuit that does just
         that.</p>

         A: Calibrating the 10-turn Potentiometer (If Needed)</h1>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The potentiometer on the circuit board panel has three
         connections. Two of the connections are at opposite end of a
         resistor. The third connection is connected to a sliding
         "wiper."</p></li>
         <li><p>Your potentiometer is actually a very precise device!
         You can control the intermediate resistances at the level of
         0.1% with a little care. To understand how, examine the dial on
         the potentiometer. It should have a window with a number in it,
         and a dial marked with a scale that goes from 00 to 99. The
         digit in the window increments with each full turn of the dial,
         so it represents the most significant digit of the setting
         number: if it says 3 in the window and the dial reads 55, then
         the setting is 355. For a 10-turn potentiometer such as yours,
         the dial should be able to run from 000 to 1000 by turning the
         knob ten full turns.</p></li>
         <li><p>First, check if your pot is already calibrated! Turn the
         knob counterclockwise until it stops. If the dial reads 000 in
         this position, your pot is calibrated.</p></li>
         <li><p>If the dial reads something other than 000 in this
         position, do the following procedure:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Use a 0.050” Allen key to loosen the small set-screw on
         the side of the knob.</p></li>
         <li><p>Pull the entire dial off the panel.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn the inner knob that remains on your panel
         counterclockwise until it stops.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn the now-detached knob until the dial reads
         000.</p></li>
         <li><p>Lock the dial by depressing the black switch on knob
         (and verify that the dial still reads 000).</p></li>
         <li><p>Push the dial back onto the inner knob, rotating the
         outside of the dial <strong>counterclockwise</strong> until it
         snaps in place against the panel and wont rotate. The dial
         should still read 000. If it doesnt, repeat the last three
         steps.</p></li>
         <li><p>Use the Allen key to tighten the set screw. Check the
         calibration again: the knob should stop at 000 and
         1000.</p></li>
