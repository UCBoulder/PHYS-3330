         <h2 data-number="2.1" id="breadboard"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Breadboard</h2>
         <p>Before modern prototyping boards, people would take wooden cutting boards (aka breadboards) and tack nails into them to provide scaffolding for testing circuits. <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/history">Take a look!</a> Modern prototyping boards are far more sophisticated but are affectionately still called breadboards.</p>
         <p>Breadboards allow you to quickly create and modify circuits without needing to solder anything. Once the circuit works and meets the desired specifications, a printed circuit board (PCB) can be designed and made. All the components can be soldered to the PCB and the circuit can be mounted in a metal case to shield it from external electromagnetic fields. Present technology allows anyone to cheaply design, layout, and print professional circuit boards. For example: <a href="http://www.expresspcb.com/" class="uri">http://www.expresspcb.com/</a></p>

         <p>Breadboards are composed of several holes that you can stick wires into. The holes form rows of metallic connection (as seen in Figure <a href="#fig:breadpins">1</a>). Each of these rows are constructed like little grabbers that allow for secure connections (as seen in Figure <a href="#fig:breadrow">2</a>).</p>

         <p>Our breadboards have custom built headers (see Figure <a href="#fig:breadheader">3</a>) to allow you to easily interface your equipment (scope, power supply, function generator, etc.) with the breadboard. All the connectors, switches, and potentiometers are connected to the green screw terminals that wires can be clamped in to connect to the breadboard.</p>

         <p>An ideal voltage source (no internal resistance) drives current around the loop of two resistors shown in Figure <a href="#fig:ideal-vd">5</a> (all three circuits in this figure are equivalent!). Each resistor has a voltage drop across it due to the current running through them, so the voltage difference labeled <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> will be less than the voltage applied to the whole circuit.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.2.1" id="sec:1.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>What is the current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> through each resistor? Represent these with respect to <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>. <em>Hint:</em> the resistors are in series, so the current through them is the same.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.2.2" id="sec:1.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>What is the voltage across <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>? Express this with respect to the current. Explain why this is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span>.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.2.3" id="sec:1.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>Express <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> and the two resistors <em>Hint:</em> this expression should not depend on the current.</p>
         <p>Make a Python function that computes <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> that takes <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> as inputs. You will likely find this function useful throughout the semester.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.2.4" id="sec:1.4"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>Build the circuit shown in Figure <a href="#fig:ideal-vd">5</a> in LTspice. Use these values</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p><span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in} = 10\text{ V}\)</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span class="math inline">\(R_1 = 1\text{ k}\Omega\)</span></p></li>
         <li><p><span class="math inline">\(R_2 = 3\text{ k}\Omega\)</span></p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>First calculate <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> using your results from the previous questions. Then run a transient simulation and measure <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span>. If your calculations and simulation do not agree, resolve any issues (this could be due to a mistake in your calculations or in setting up your simulation).</p>
         <h2 data-number="2.3" id="transfer-function"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Transfer Function</h2>
         <p>A <strong>transfer function</strong> <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is ratio of an output to an input. In this class, we are interested in voltage transfer functions, so</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
         T = \frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}}
         \end{equation}\]</span></p>
         <p>A <strong><em>voltage divider’s</em></strong> output will always be less than the input, so the transfer function will range between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.3.1" id="sec:2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>Write down the equation for the transfer function of the ideal voltage divider. <em>Hint:</em> use the result of problem <a href="#sec:1.3">2.2.3</a>. This should only depend on the values of the two resistors, and should be unitless.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.3.2" id="sec:2.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>For <span class="math inline">\(R_1 = 2\text{ k}\Omega\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_2 = 1\text{ k}\Omega\)</span>, what is the value of the transfer function?</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.3.3" id="sec:2.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>For a <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(10\text{ V}\)</span>, what will <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> be (using the resistance values above)?</p>
         <p>In LTspice, build this circuit and run a transient simulation. Measure the output voltage in the simulation to confirm that your calculation is correct. If not, resolve any mistakes in either your simulation or calculation. Screen shot the circuit and result in LTspice.</p>
         <h2 data-number="2.4" id="input-and-output-impedance"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Input and Output Impedance</h2>
         <div id="fig:input-output-impedance" class="fignos">
         <figure>
         <img src="../resources/lab2fig/output-input-impedance.png" style="height:7.5cm" alt="" /><figcaption><span>Figure 6:</span> Any circuit being powered can be modeled as a single impedance (input impedance) <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>. In general, real power sources have output impedance <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span> (modeled by a resistor in series)</figcaption>
         </figure>
         </div>
         <p>A <em>real</em> power source has series resistance (aka output impedance) <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span>. When your circuit draws current from the power source, current will pass through <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span>, so voltage will drop across it (according to Ohm’s law). Even complicated circuits can often be modeled as a single resistor representing the “input impedance” of the circuit. The input impedance describes how the whole circuit opposes current. If the circuit being powered is just a resistor, then the input impedance is just the resistance of this resistor. Regardless, the input impedance can be thought of as the load on the circuit.</p>
         <p>When the power source with output impedance <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span> drives the load with input impedance <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>, the output and input impedances form a voltage divider, where the input of the voltage divider is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(int)}\)</span> and the output is <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)}\)</span>. The transfer function of this voltage divider is then</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[T = \frac{V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)}}{V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)}} = \frac{R_i}{R_o+R_i}\]</span></p>
         <h3 data-number="2.4.1" id="sec:3.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>Confirm that your solution for the transfer function from problem <a href="#sec:2.1">2.3.1</a> is consistent with the transfer function shown above. If it is not, resolve the discrepancy.</p>
         <h3 data-number="2.4.2" id="sec:3.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>The power delivered to the circuit or the load is determined by</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[P = I^2 R_i= I V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)} = \frac{(V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)})^2}{R_i}\]</span></p>
         <p>For a given <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span>, find the <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> that maximizes the power delivered.</p>
         <p><em>Hint:</em> Express <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in terms of <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(int)}\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)}\)</span>, and then find the extrema (maximum) by finding the value of <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> that makes the derivative zero; i.e. find <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> such that</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial P}{\partial R_i} = 0\]</span></p>
         <h3 data-number="2.4.3" id="sec:3.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Prelab Question</h3>
         <p>Impedance matching is the process of matching load impedances with a power source’s output impedance. For high frequency signals, impedance matching is very important, but it is also commonly done because, for a given <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span>, matching the input impedance to the same value will allow for the maximum amount of power to be delivered to the circuit.

         <li><span class="math inline">\(R_o = 10\ \Omega\)</span></li>

         <p>Notice that, even though the curves peak at <span class="math inline">\(R_i=R_o\)</span>, that decreasing <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span> still increases the power at all <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>. To deliver a lot of power, having a low output impedance is often the best choice, but this isn’t always a parameter we can control.</p>
         <p>Here is some sample code for plotting. You can use <code>%matplotlib widget</code> to allow you to interact with the inline plot. Otherwise, the default should be <code>%matplotlib inline</code>, and this might be preferable to you. To use the widget you will need to install have <a href="https://matplotlib.org/ipympl/">ipympl</a> installed. This can be done with <code>pip install ipympl</code> in your Anaconda prompt with your environment activated.</p>

         </div>
         <p>In the lab activities we will discover that the circuit shown in Figure <a href="#fig:modified-vd">8</a> more accurately models a voltage divider being measured. <span class="math inline">\(R_3\)</span> is an impedance/resistance in parallel with <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> which is due to the impedance of a voltage measuring device. This model can also be used to predict the affects of placing an external load on a voltage divider.</p>
         <p>The transfer function for this circuit can be solved by adding <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_3\)</span> in parallel; we can call this parallel resistance <span class="math inline">\(R_p\)</span>. The circuit with these two combined is just a voltage divider with a transfer function:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[T = \frac{R_p}{R_1 + R_p}\]</span></p>
         <p>where</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R_p=\frac{R_2R_3}{R_2+R_3}\]</span></p>
         <p>Before plugging in <span class="math inline">\(R_p\)</span>, it is helpful to divide the top and bottom by <span class="math inline">\(R_p\)</span> to make the transfer function only have one <span class="math inline">\(R_p\)</span> in its equation</p>

         <p>As a final step, the <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> can be distributed in the denominator to put this in a nice form</p>

         <p>Thevenin’s theorem states that any circuit (and therefore the voltage divider) can be modeled as an ideal voltage source with an output impedance <span class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span> (see the figure below).</p>

         <p>Naively, one would think that when a load <span class="math inline">\(R_3\)</span> is attached to the voltage divider, you might expect the voltage applied will be the <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> of the voltage divider: i.e. <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in} \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}\)</span>, and indeed, the Thevenin voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span> <em>is</em> this. However, the Thevenin equivalent resistance is very significant, and the voltage that gets to <span class="math inline">\(R_3\)</span> won’t be <span class="math inline">\(V_T\)</span>.</p>

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Many circuits require DC power connections. This semester, you will commonly use components that need <span class="math inline">\(+15\text{ V}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-15\text{ V}\)</span>. Connect the power supply to the breadboard header using banana cables, so that you can get <span class="math inline">\(+15\text{ V}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-15\text{ V}\)</span> to your board.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>USE A COLOR CODE FOR THE POWER CONNECTIONS!</strong> The convention used in this course is <strong>black = ground</strong>, <span style="color: red;"><strong>red = <span class="math inline">\(+15\text{ V}\)</span></strong></span>, and <span style="color: blue;"><strong>blue = <span class="math inline">\(-15\text{ V}\)</span></strong></span>. Using a consistent color code will allow you and others to understand and debug your circuits quickly. You are also less likely to plug something in incorrectly and burn up a component. You should also have a white colored banana jack on your interface panel. You may find that this is useful during your final project phase if you require a 3rd voltage source. Remember to note your color code in your lab notebook.</p></li>
         <li><p>Once you have power connected to the interface panel, use jumper wires (from the spools of wire) to connect the screw terminals to to the breadboard (+15, -15, and ground). The long rails that run the length of the board are best for distributing power to all of your components.</p>
         <ul>
         <li><strong><em>Note:</em> Use these long columns for only DC power or ground.</strong></li>
         <li>There is capacitance between all the breadboard connections, and the longer the row/column, the more capacitance there will be to a neighbor.</li>
         <li>We will learn in lab 4 that putting capacitance between power and ground is actually helpful, so connecting ground next to both your <span class="math inline">\(+15\text{ V}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-15\text{ V}\)</span> columns is good.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>Good electrical contact is essential when you plug in components or wires. Use 22-gauge solid wire, not stranded wire. The 22-gauge wire should make a good connection with the conductors inside the board without slipping out easily. Push in each wire until you feel the contacts grip. <strong>Don’t force larger wires into the protoboard. You can damage the connectors.</strong></p>
         <ul>
         <li><em>Note:</em> rotating the screws counter-clockwise (like loosening a screw) will lower/open the clamp of the terminal, allowing you place wire in the terminal; you can then turn the screw clockwise (like tightening a screw) to raise/close the clamp onto the wire. You should inspect and tug on wires when you clamp them to ensure they are connected securely.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><p>It is essential to have reliable access to ground from any point on the breadboard. The interface panel is wired such that outer conductor on the BNC connectors are connected to the <strong>black</strong> banana jack, which forces a common chassis ground. This is indicated on the wiring diagram printed on the interface panel. To confirm this, measure the resistance between the black banana socket and the outer conductors of the BNC ports. They should read basically <span class="math inline">\(0\ \Omega\)</span>. Record this in your lab notebook.</p></li>

         <li><p>Build a voltage divider similar to the one shown in Figure <a href="#fig:ideal-vd">5</a> using resistors of around <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ k}\Omega\)</span>. Draw a diagram of the circuit in your lab notebook. Make sure to label the resistors and record all measured component values and voltages.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure each resistor with your DMM before inserting it into your circuit and record the value. Why should you measure component values before placing them in the circuit?</p></li>
         <li><p>Predict the output voltage you should measure based on your input voltage and resistance measurements. Include your calculations and numerical predictions in your lab notebook.</p></li>
         <li><p>Now, connect your voltage divider so that it divides the <span class="math inline">\(+15\text{ V}\)</span>. Measure the output voltage using your DMM and then using your oscilloscope. Record your measurements. <em>Do not have the DMM and the oscilloscope connected at the same time because each may perturb the measurement differently.</em></p></li>

         <!--6.  *Complete this step only if your model and measurements did not agree.* If your model and measurements did not agree, you will have to either refine your model or your experiment. Lets start by refining your model. Consider the input resistance of your measurement device. Draw a circuit diagram that includes that resistance. *HINT: See Figure @fig:modified-vd*. Derive an expression for the output voltage now including the unknown measurement device resistance. Use this new model to determine the input resistance of measurement device. (that is, rearrange your equation to solve for $R_3$.. You did this in the prelab).-->

         <li><p>Complete the steps in the previous section for two additional voltage dividers, one using resistors <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ M}\Omega\)</span> and one with resistors <span class="math inline">\(10\text{ M}\Omega\)</span> (with both the DMM and the scope).</p></li>

         <li><p>Which model explored in the prelab will more accurately represent your circuit while it is being measured?

         <h2 data-number="4.5" id="hidden-voltage-dividers-output-impedance"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Hidden Voltage Dividers (Output Impedance)</h2>
         <p>In this section we will explore how a real voltage source with an output impedance voltage divides with a load (input impedance).</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Draw a diagram representing a real voltage source powering a load.</p></li>
         <li><p>Remember last week when you set the function generator to an output termination of <em>High Z</em>? We want to do this EVERY TIME we use the function generator in this class. This does not change the output impedance of the function generator: it’s ALWAYS <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>, but by default, it <em>assumes</em> you are impedance matching everything with <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> (you worked out why this might be important to do in the prelab). Turn on your function generator and set it to <em>High Z</em>. If you don’t remember how to change this setting, refer to Appendix B in Lab 1.</p></li>
         <li><p>Grab a speaker (this will be your load) and use your DMM to measure the resistance of the speaker. On your diagram label the resistances of the output impedance of the function generator (<span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span>) and the impedance of your speaker.</p></li>
         <li><p>What you program the function generator to deliver to your load will be <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(int)}\)</span>; if the transfer function is <span class="math inline">\(T=V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)}/V_\text{supply}^\text{(int)}\)</span>, calculate this transfer function. This will determine how much of your function generator’s voltage will actually reach the load.</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up the function generator and the oscilloscope.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Set up the function generator and the oscilloscope so that you can read Channel 1 from the function generator with Channel 1 of the oscilloscope (use a BNC T-connector so that later you can eventually connect this to your speaker).</p></li>
         <li><p>Connect the <em>Sync</em> on the function generator with Channel 4 of the oscilloscope.</p></li>
         <li><p>Create a <span class="math inline">\(2\ \text{V}_\text{pp}\)</span> sine wave with a <span class="math inline">\(432\ \text{Hz}\)</span> frequency and trigger on the <em>Sync</em> (in the trigger menu, change the channel to Channel 4). This will provide a nice lower frequency tone (a <span class="math inline">\(\text{C}_4\)</span> note) at a volume that won’t be too obnoxious to your neighbors.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>Confirm on the oscilloscope that the frequency and the amplitude of your wave match the settings on the function generator; i.e. measure and record the values and how you determined them.</p></li>
         <li><p>Apply the signal from the function generator to the speaker (use the T-connector, so you can still see it on the oscilloscope). You can use mini grabbers to connect to the two ends of the speaker.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Now what is the amplitude of the sine wave on Channel 1 of the oscilliscope?</p></li>
         <li><p>Why did the amplitude change after applying the load to the function generator’s output? Disconnect the speaker: did the amplitude recover? Why? Reconnect the function generator to your circuit and confirm the voltage changes.</p></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li><p>When you measure the voltage without the speaker, there is (virtually) no current, so no voltage drops across the <span class="math inline">\(50\ \Omega\)</span> output impedance of the function generator. In this case, we are measuring the internal, source voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(int)}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> of our voltage divider model). When you apply the speaker, current flows and voltage drops across the output impedance, so that the full voltage doesn’t reach the load <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}^\text{(ext)}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> in our voltage divider model). Using both measurements calculate the transfer function.</p></li>
         <li><p>Compare the calculated result from the measurements to the calculation from the model based on the resistances.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>Since neither the impedance of the speaker nor the output impedance of the function generator can be changed, in order to get more power to the speaker, you will have to design more circuitry to deliver the signal in a way that draws little to no current from the function generator. In Lab 4, you will learn to build a voltage buffer circuit that does just that.</p>

         <li><p>Set the dial to some point between 0 and 1000, but not 500. Since you have a 10-turn, <span class="math inline">\(10\text{ k}\Omega\)</span> pot, each “tick” of the dial represents ~<span class="math inline">\(10\ \Omega\)</span>; therefore, the resistance between the wiper and one of the terminals should be equal to the dial value multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(10\ \Omega\)</span>.

         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The potentiometer on the circuit board panel has three connections. Two of the connections are at opposite end of a resistor. The third connection is connected to a sliding "wiper."</p></li>
         <li><p>Your potentiometer is actually a very precise device! You can control the intermediate resistances at the level of 0.1% with a little care. To understand how, examine the dial on the potentiometer. It should have a window with a number in it, and a dial marked with a scale that goes from 00 to 99. The digit in the window increments with each full turn of the dial, so it represents the most significant digit of the setting number: if it says 3 in the window and the dial reads 55, then the setting is 355. For a 10-turn potentiometer such as yours, the dial should be able to run from 000 to 1000 by turning the knob ten full turns.</p></li>
         <li><p>First, check if your pot is already calibrated! Turn the knob counterclockwise until it stops. If the dial reads 000 in this position, your pot is calibrated.</p></li>
         <li><p>If the dial reads something other than 000 in this position, do the following procedure:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>Use a 0.050" Allen key to loosen the small set-screw on the side of the knob.</p></li>
         <li><p>Pull the entire dial off the panel.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn the inner knob that remains on your panel counterclockwise until it stops.</p></li>
         <li><p>Turn the now-detached knob until the dial reads 000.</p></li>
         <li><p>Lock the dial by depressing the black switch on knob (and verify that the dial still reads 000).</p></li>
         <li><p>Push the dial back onto the inner knob, rotating the outside of the dial <strong>counterclockwise</strong> until it snaps in place against the panel and wont rotate. The dial should still read 000. If it doesnt, repeat the last three steps.</p></li>
         <li><p>Use the Allen key to tighten the set screw. Check the calibration again: the knob should stop at 000 and 1000.</p></li>
