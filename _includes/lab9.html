         <p>In this lab, we will gloss over the basics of digital electronics. You will utilize some of the most basic components that are used to build more complex circuits, like computers. You will learn to use logic gates, memory circuits, and digital clocks (a kind of oscillator), and you will learn how to combine gates and predict the behavior with Boolean algebra.</p>
         <p>This subject can easily span an entire semester, but we will just dip our toes in the water so that you will be equipped to employ some basic components into your final project if needed. The digital clock you will build in this lab, for example, has many applications. It is worth also investigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_oscillator">other kinds of oscillators</a> for your project (if relevant).</p>

         <h1 data-number="2" id="intro-to-digital-circuits"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Intro to Digital Circuits</h1>
         <p>In almost all experiments in the physical sciences, the signals that represent physical quantities start out as <em>analog</em> waveforms. However, in the modern day, all our data eventually ends up on a computer (which is a digital circuit) to store and display. This requires analog-to-digital converters (ADC or A/D converter). There are plenty of commercially available ADCs that read voltages and connect to computers via USB, ethernet, RS-232, PCI, or PCIe; however, most instruments, such as the oscilloscope you use, have ADCs built in and communicate with a computer via USB, RS-232, ethernet, or GPIB. Scientists usually buy their data acquisition equipment rather than build it, so they usually don’t have to know too much about the digital circuitry that makes it work.</p>
         <p>In lab 5 you built a 3-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Both DACs and ADCs have limited precision by the number of bits. A set of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> bits has <span class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> possible different values. The precision will be determined by the range of value and the number of possible values. If you try to represent an analog voltage by <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> bits, your minimum uncertainty will be about <span class="math inline">\(1\%\)</span> of the total range, since there are <span class="math inline">\(2^7 = 128\)</span> possible combinations of <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> bits. For higher accuracy you need more bits.</p>
         <p>There are three key components of digital circuits:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>logic</p></li>
         <li><p>memory</p></li>
         <li><p>timing</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Transistors are the building blocks of all of these components, but both logic and memory can be exclusively made with <strong>gates</strong>.</p>
         <p><strong>DEFINITION: Logic gates</strong> - a simple transistor circuit that implements some Boolean logic operation.</p>
         <p>In digital circuits, it is easier to abstract the discrete transistor circuits into gate circuits (similar to how we can treat an op-amp as a lumped element completely independent of the exact transistor layout that makes up the op-amp). In computers, gates are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS">CMOS</a> (where gates are designed with MOSFETs), but gates originated as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic">TTL</a> (where gates are made from BJTs). Most gates on DIP chips are still TTL (including the ones we will use in this lab).</p>
         <p>Gates can be used to construct arbitrary combinatorial logic (they can generate any <em>truth-table</em>), but to create a machine that steps through a sequence of instructions like a computer does, we also need <em>memory</em> and a <em>clock</em>. The fundamental single-bit memory element of digital electronics is called a <em>flip-flop</em>. We will study two types, called SR (or RS) and JK. Both of these can be built exclusively with gates (the ones we use are TTL). A <em>digital clock</em> is a repeating digital waveform used to step a digital circuit through a sequence of states. We will introduce the 555 timer chip and use it to generate a clock signal. Digital circuits that are able to step through a sequence of states with the aid of flip-flops and a clock are called sequential logic.</p>
         <p>The voltage in a digital circuit is allowed to be in only one of two states: HIGH or LOW. HIGH is taken to mean logical <span class="math inline">\((1)\)</span> or logical TRUE. LOW is taken to mean logical <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span> or logical FALSE. In the TTL logic family (see Figure <a href="#fig:TTLvolt">1</a>), the “ideal” HIGH and LOW voltage levels are <span class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span>, respectively, but any input voltage in the range of <span class="math inline">\(2–5\text{ V}\)</span> is interpreted as HIGH, and any input voltage in the range of <span class="math inline">\(0–0.8\text{ V}\)</span> as LOW. Voltages outside this range are undefined, and therefore “illegal,” except if they occur briefly during transitions. If the input to a TTL circuit is a voltage in this undefined range, the response is unpredictable, with the circuit sometimes interpreting it as a <span class="math inline">\(“1”\)</span> and sometimes as a <span class="math inline">\(“0.”\)</span> Avoid sending voltages in the undefined range into TTL components.</p>

         <h2 data-number="3.1" id="digital-logic-gates"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Digital Logic Gates</h2>
         <p>The flow of digital signals is controlled by transistors in various configurations depending on the logic family (we mentioned CMOS and TTL above). For most purposes, we can imagine that the logic gates are composed of several ideal switches with just two states: OPEN and CLOSED. The state of a switch is controlled by a digital signal. The switch remains closed so long as a logical <span class="math inline">\((1)\)</span> signal is applied. A logical <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span> control signal keeps it open.</p>
         <p>Logic signals interact by means of gates. The three fundamental gates, AND, OR, and NOT, are named after the three fundamental operations of logic that they carry out. The AND and OR gates each have two inputs and one output. The output state is determined by the states of the two inputs. The NOT gate has one input and one output.</p>
         <p>The function of each gate is defined by a truth table, which specifies the output state for every possible combination of input states. The output values of the truth tables can be understood in terms of two switches. If the switches are in series, you get the AND function. Parallel switches perform the OR operation. The most common gates are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:simpgates">2</a> and Figure <a href="#fig:compgates">3</a>. A small circle after a gate or at an input indicates negation (NOT).</p>

         <h2 data-number="3.2" id="memory-elements-and-flip-flops"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Memory Elements and Flip-Flops</h2>
         <p>In sequential logic circuits, the output depends upon previous values of the input signals as well as their present-time values. Such circuits necessarily include memory elements that store the logic values of the earlier signals. The fundamental memory circuit is the RS memory element. The JK flip-flop has an RS flip-flop at its core, but it adds circuitry that synchronizes output transitions to a clock signal. Timing control by a clock is essential to most complex sequential circuits.</p>
         <p><strong>RS memory circuit</strong></p>
         <p>The truth table for the RS memory element shows how the circuit remembers. Suppose it starts in a state with <span class="math inline">\(Q=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R=S=0\)</span>. A positive pulse <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> at the input sets it into the state <span class="math inline">\(Q=1\)</span>, where it remains after <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> returns to zero. A later pulse <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> on the other input resets the circuit to <span class="math inline">\(Q=0\)</span>, where it remains until the next <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> pulse.</p>

         </div>
         <p><strong>JK flip-flop (TTL74107)</strong></p>
         <p>There are three kinds of inputs to the JK flip-flop:</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li>Data inputs <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span></li>
         <li>The clock <span class="math inline">\(\text{CK}\)</span></li>
         <li>The direct input clear <span class="math inline">\(\text{CLR}\)</span></li>
         </ol>
         <p>There are two outputs: <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and it’s complement <span class="math inline">\(\bar{Q}\)</span> (not <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>).</p>
         <p>The index <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> counts the number of clock pulses since the start of the experiment. In the absence of a clock pulse, the output remains unchanged at the previously acquired value, <span class="math inline">\(Q_n\)</span>, which is independent of the present-time data inputs <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. Only on the arrival of a clock pulse, $, can the output change to a new value, <span class="math inline">\(Q_{n+1}\)</span>. The value of <span class="math inline">\(Q_n\)</span> depends on the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> inputs in the way specified in the truth table. The change occurs at the falling (trailing) edge of the clock pulse, indicated by a downward arrow in the truth table in Figure <a href="#fig:jkflipflop">5</a>. The direct input, <span class="math inline">\(\text{CLR}\)</span>, overrides the clock and data inputs. During normal operation, <span class="math inline">\(\text{CLR} = 1\)</span>. At the moment <span class="math inline">\(\text{CLR}\)</span> goes to zero, the output goes to zero and remains there as long as <span class="math inline">\(\text{CLR} = 0\)</span>.</p>

This can be done by moving wires between two rails (one at ground and on at <span class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span>); however, for the memory circuits, it can cause problems to leave an input floating for too long (the time it takes to move the wire). In these cases, it is crucial to use a switch to switch between these voltages.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>The middle pin of a switch is connected to either of the other two of the pins depending on the position of the lever. Connect one outer pin of the switch to ground and the other to <span class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span>.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure the middle pin with your DMM with respect to ground and confirm that the switch switches between the two desired voltages.</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>The logic level of any state (input, output, or any intermediate state) using a light emitting diode (LED). When a state is <span class="math inline">\((1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span> will be applied to one end, and the LED will light up, and when a state is <span class="math inline">\((0)\)</span>, there won’t be a voltage across the LED, so it won’t light up. This is a nice way to visualize what is happening in your circuit without needing to endless probe around with your DMM. You will likely want quite a bit of LEDs for this purpose, so you may want to use at least one 10-LED bank (MV57164). It can be nice to use individual LEDs (HLMP-C625) to be able to place each one physically where you want in the circuit.</p>
         <ol type="1">
         <li><p>To limit the amount of current though each diode, place a resistor in series with it. What value of resistor should you use to limit the current to <span class="math inline">\(20\text{ mA}\)</span> (don’t forget that the LED has a voltage drop of about <span class="math inline">\(2\text{ V}\)</span>)? Record your calculation. Check that the LED lights up appropriately. If you don’t see light, try reversing the <span class="math inline">\(+5\text{ V}\)</span> and ground connections. You can review Lab 6 for more information on LEDs.</p></li>
         <li><p>Connect an LED to the output of each switch and toggle them to confirm you can visualize the state of each switch. These switches can be used as the inputs for all the circuits you will build moving forward. You should use other LEDs to visualize output states of your circuits as well.</p></li>

This is a perfect opportunity to use the switch on the front panel of your setup. Connect LEDs to both outputs to record your data.
