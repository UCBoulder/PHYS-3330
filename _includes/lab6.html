         <h1 data-number="1" id="goals"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Goals</h1>
         <p>In this lab, you will design and build a photometer (a device that measures the intensity of light) based on a silicon photodiode and a current-to-voltage amplifier whose output is proportional to the intensity of incident light. First, you will use it to measure the room light intensity. Then you will set up and investigate an optical communication link in which the transmitter is a light emitting diode (LED) and the receiver is your photodiode detector.</p>
         <p>In this lab you will get your first exposure to diodes. There are three kinds of diodes you will use this week:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>Rectifier diodes (often just referred to as “diodes”),</p></li>
         <li><p>Light emitting diodes (LEDs),</p></li>
         <li><p>Photodiodes.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>You will also learn how to build a new op-amp circuit: the transimpedance amplifier. This type of amplifier is a current to voltage converter, which means that it takes current as an input and outputs a voltage.</p>
         <p>In this lab you will model the following physical systems:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>A transimpedance amplifier</p></li>
         <li><p>The sensitivity to light of a photodiode,</p></li>
         <li><p>A photometer measurement system.</p></li>
         </ul>
         <p>This week, you will build:</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>A device that measures light intensity (photometer),</p></li>
         <li><p>A transducer device that can send information/signals via optical light from one circuit to another (optical communication link).</p></li>
         </ul>

         <p>A diode is a device which conducts electricity primarily in one direction. The original diodes were in the form of vacuum tubes (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_YFpfDqqA">here’s a fun video if you care to learn more</a>), but today they are made from semiconducting materials (like silicon) because of their relative robustness, long lifetimes, and compact size. A diode is mode from a p-n junction where a positively-doped semiconductor (p-type) with mobile “holes” is in contact with a negatively-doped semiconductor (n-type) with mobile electrons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNi6WY7WKAI">Watch this short video.</a></p>
         <p>A semiconductor diode has two terminals: an anode (+) and a cathode (-); a good mnemonic to remember the polarity of anodes and cathodes is remembering that cats (cathodes) have negative attitudes (sorry cat lovers). The symbol for a diode resembles an arrow with a hat (see the diagram in Figure <a href="#fig:diode-char">1</a>), where the hat is referred to as “the bar” and is the cathode; a good mnemonic is seeing the symbol as an arrow which points in the direction that the diode allows current, since current flows from positive to negative, “the bar” is the cathode.</p>
         <p>The fundamental property of a diode is its tendency to conduct electric current in only one direction. The diode can be operated in three regions (these regions are shown in different colors in Figure <a href="#fig:diode-char">1</a>).</p>
         <ul>
         <li><p>The first region, called <em>forward biased</em>, is when the anode has a higher potential relative to the cathode by at least some threshold voltage (about <span class="math inline">\(0.6\text{ V}\)</span> for silicon diodes). When the anode-cathode voltage is above the threshold voltage the diode conducts with almost zero resistance and has a constant <span class="math inline">\(0.6\text{ V}\)</span> drop across it.</p></li>
         <li><p>The second region of operation is where the cathode has a lower potential relative to the anode. This region is called reversed biased and essentially no current can flow.</p></li>
         <li><p>Finally, if the potential difference from the cathode to the anode is negative and larger than some breakdown voltage, the diode will again conduct. Regular diodes are not used in the break down region (on purpose), but Zener diodes have well defined breakdown voltages and are used for several purpose (these may be useful for your final project).</p></li>
         </ul>

         </figure>
         </div>
         <p>The IV curve above describes the behavior of the diode as a function of voltage applied. A simple way to interpret this plot is that the diode only allows current to flow in the forward direction (the direction the diode symbol’s arrow points) when the voltage is above the forward voltage, and it will allow current in the reverse direction only if a negative voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. In general, to know the amount of current, requires analysis of the resistors involved in the circuit.</p>

First determine which region the diode will be in as a result of the value of <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span>. In this region, will there be current? In this region, what can the voltage across the diode be?

         <p>LEDs act electronically like any other diode; however, unlike regular diodes, it also emits light when forward-biased due to direct radiative recombination of electrons and holes. The forward voltage drop of LEDs is typically higher than <span class="math inline">\(0.6\text{ V}\)</span>. The HLMP-C625 you will use this week has a forward voltage of about <span class="math inline">\(1.9\text{ V}\)</span> because the LED is made of <span class="math inline">\(\text{AlInGaP}\)</span> instead of silicon.</p>
         <p>When electrons cross from the n-type region to the p-type region in a diode, they dissipate energy. In regular diodes, the energy is converted into heat in the form of phonons, but LEDs have the energy converted into photons; therefore, the color of the light is dictated by the band gap energy of the diode.</p>
         <!-- The HLMP-C625 light emitting diode used in this lab acts electrically like any other diode. However, unlike regular diodes it also emits light when forward-biased due to direct radiative recombination of electrons and holes. The forward voltage drop is about 1.9 V rather than 0.6 V because the LED is made of AlInGaP instead of silicon.-->

         <p>To turn on an LED, you have to run a certain amount of current through it. Current limiting resistors (this is just any resistor in series with the LED) are needed to limit the current to a specific value. Too little current and the LED will be too dim and too much current will destroy the LED. In the lab you will drive the HLMP-C625 LED with <span class="math inline">\(8\text{ V}\)</span>. Determine the resistance needed in series with LED to get <span class="math inline">\(20\text{ mA}\)</span> of current through it. Don’t forget to consider the forward voltage which is <span class="math inline">\(1.9\text{ V}\)</span>.</p>

         <p>PIN photodiodes have an intrinsic region (undoped) between the p-type and n-type regions. Photons of appropriate wavelength absorb in the material creating an electron-hole pair; when reverse biased, the electric field generated by the voltage will pull the pair apart generating a small current. Therefore, (when reverse biased) the photodiode generates current proportional to the number of photons absorbed by the material. A sketch of the photodiode structure is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:photodiode">3</a>.</p>
         <!--The PD204 photodiode used in this experiment is a p-intrinsic-n (PIN) silicon diode operated in reverse bias. A sketch of the photodiode structure is shown in Figure @fig:photodiode. The very thin p-type conducting layer acts as a window to admit light into the crystal. The reverse bias voltage maintains a strong electric field throughout the intrinsic region forming an extended depletion layer. The depletion layer should be thicker than the absorption length for photons in silicon in order to maximize the efficiency. An incident photon whose energy exceeds the band gap energy can be absorbed to produce an electron-hole pair by photoelectric excitation of a valence electron into the conduction band. The charge carriers are swept out of the crystal by the internal electric field to appear as a photocurrent at the terminals. The photocurrent is proportional to light intensity over a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude.-->
         <p>The amount of current generated can be determined by the following equation</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I=S_{\lambda}P_o\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(P_o\)</span> is the <strong>optical</strong> power (number of photons per second times the photon energy) and <span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> is the wavelength dependent sensitivity of the photodiode (in units of <span class="math inline">\(\text{A/W}\)</span>). A photon of wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> carries energy <span class="math inline">\(E_\text{photon}=hc/\lambda\)</span>, so the photon rate is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[R_\text{photon}=\frac{P_o}{E_\text{photon}} = \frac{P_o\lambda}{hc}\]</span></p>
         <p>Let’s consider what <span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> would be for an ideal photodiode that converts every photon into an electron/hole pair. The rate of photons per second will then directly correspond to that many electrons per second worth of current, so the current is <span class="math inline">\(I=eR=P\ (\lambda e)/(hc)\)</span>. However, in a real photodiode, not every photon gets absorbed and generates an electron; the probability that a photon is absorbed (and generates an electron/hole pair) depends on the wavelength <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and the quantum efficiency of the photodiode <span class="math inline">\(q_{\lambda}\)</span> (which is a <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> dependant number between 0 and 1).</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[S_\lambda\le q_{\lambda}\frac{\lambda e}{hc}\]</span></p>
         <p>At <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 940 nm (red), the ideal sensitivity (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(q_{\lambda}= 1\)</span>) would be <span class="math inline">\(0.76\text{ A/W}\)</span> (about <span class="math inline">\(3/4\)</span>), a fairly easy number to remember.</p>
         <p>Photodiode manufacturers typically will provide the actual <span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> in the data sheet. Because the PD204-6C photodiode comes with a curved lens, the data sheet specifies the short circuit current <span class="math inline">\(I_{SC} = 10\ \mu \text{A}\)</span> at an incident intensity of <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ mW/cm}^2\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 940\text{ nm}\)</span>. The lens has a diameter of <span class="math inline">\(d = 0.3\text{ cm}\)</span> or an area of <span class="math inline">\(0.071\text{ cm}^2\)</span>. So, an incident intensity of <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ mW/cm}^2\)</span> corresponds to a total power of <span class="math inline">\(71\ \mu \text{W}\)</span> of optical power hitting the photodiode. The sensitivity at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda= 940\text{ nm}\)</span> is then:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[S_{940} = \frac{I_{SC}}{71\ \mu\text{W}} = 0.14\text{ A/W}\]</span></p>
         <p>Note that this means the quantum efficiency at 940 nm is only 0.18 (not so great).</p>
         <p>The sensitivity at other wavelengths <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is given on the data sheet in terms of the peak sensitivity <span class="math inline">\(S_{940}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(940\text{ nm}\)</span> times a correction factor called the relative spectral response (RSR) or the relative spectral sensitivity (RSS):</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[S_{\lambda} = S_{940}\ \text{RSR}(\lambda)\]</span></p>
         <p>Figure <a href="#fig:pd204">4</a> shows the RSR (aka RSS) from the PD204-6C data sheet. You can see the maximum sensitivity is around 940 nm.</p>

         <p>All the op-amp circuits you have built so far take voltages as inputs. Since the input and output are both voltages, the gain (output/input) is unitless. Now we will look at a different kind of op-amp circuit that takes current as an input: a transimpedance amplifier. In this case, the gain is voltage/current, so it has units of Ohms (resistance).</p>

         </figure>
         </div>
         <p>The figure above shows a transimpedance amplifier circuit using an op-amp. We can analyze this circuit by applying the golden rules. First, consider the input current <span class="math inline">\(I_\text{in}\)</span> delivered from the current source; when it reaches the first node, where will the current go? The two paths are into the inverting input <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> and through <span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span>. The current golden rule tells us that no current should flow into the inverting input, so all the current will go through <span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span>. Therefore the voltage will drop from <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span> by an amount <span class="math inline">\(I_\text{in}R_F\)</span>:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = V_- - I_\text{in}R_F\]</span></p>
         <p>We can then apply the voltage golden rule that says that, when there is negative feedback, <span class="math inline">\(V_-=V_+\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(V_+\)</span> is ground, <span class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> is a virtual ground. We can plug in <span class="math inline">\(V_-=0\)</span> to the equation above to get</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = - I_\text{in}R_F\]</span></p>
         <p>The gain can then be calculated by the output divided by the input, in this case it is</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G = \frac{V_\text{out}}{I_\text{in}}=-R_F\]</span></p>
         <!--In an ordinary inverting amplifier, the input voltage is applied to a resistor, and the amplifier generates an output voltage in response to the current that flows through the input resistor to the virtual ground at the negative op-amp input. A current-to-voltage amplifier (Figure @fig:trans-amp) is an inverting amplifier with the input current $I_{in}$ supplied by the photodiode and applied to the inverting op-amp input. Since no current flows into the op-amp input, the output voltage must be $V_{out} = – I_{in}R_F$. The ideal (Golden Rules result) low-frequency gain of a current-to-voltage amplifier is

         $$G=\frac{V_{out}}{I_{in}}=-R_F$$-->
         <p>This gain has the units of impedance i.e., Ohms, and it is often called a transimpedance gain. The current-to-voltage amplifier is also called a transimpedance amplifier. This type of amplifier is very common in research labs when transducer based measurements result in a predictable amount of current, such as photodiodes, photo multiplier tubes, ion detectors, etc.</p>

         Answer the following questions using Mathematica for the plots. You can use either Mathematica for the rest of the questions as well or do them by hand. **Make sure to have the Mathematica notebook for your lab section as well.**

         ## Simple diodes {#sec:simp-diodes}

         1.  Consider the circuit in Figure @fig:diode-cir. If the diode is ideal with a threshold voltage of 0.6 V and a breakdown voltage of 50 V, predict the behavior of the current $I$ (consider clockwise current to be positive) and $V_{out}$ as a function of the source voltage $V_{in}$. Make a table of the predicted $I$ and $V_{out}$ for the following values of $V_{in}$: -2 V, 0 V, +0.5 V, +0.6 V, +0.7 V, +1 V, +2 V, +4 V.

         2.  Now, consider the case where $V_{in}$ is a sine wave with a 3 V amplitude (6 V peak-to-peak) centered on $V_{in}$ = 0 V. Predict $V_{out}$ and $I$ as a function of time and sketch your predictions (by hand or with Mathematica) over 3 periods.

         ## Transimpedance amplifier {#sec:trans-pre}

         1.  For the current-to-voltage amplifier in Figure @fig:photodetector, choose a value for the feedback resistor $R_F$ so that an incident white-light ($\lambda$ = 555 nm) optical power of P = 71 $\mu$W produces an output of 10 V.

         2.  The small feedback capacitor $C_F$ is used to suppress spontaneous oscillations. The transimpedance gain of the amplifier at any particular frequency is $–Z_F$, where $Z_F$ is the effective impedance of the parallel $R_FC_F$ circuit. The gain rolls off at high frequencies with a bandwidth of $f_B = 1/(2\pi R_FC_F)$, just like any low-pass filter. The bandwidth will suffer if $C_F$ is too large. What is the bandwidth $f_B$ if $C_F$ = 10 pF?

         3.  What are the DC values of the voltages at the + and - inputs and at the output of the op-amp for zero light on the photodiode? Consider the ideal situation where the diode allows zero current when there is no light hitting it. (In reality, about 10 nA of "dark current" flows through the diode even with no light on it.)

         ## Optical communication link

         1.  To drive the transmitter, the function generator will be adjusted to produce a square wave with a high level of 8 V (unloaded) and a low level of 0 V. The high-level (8 V) should give a 20 mA forward current in the LED, and the low level (0 V) should give 0 mA. **Find the value of the series resistor Rs that gives the correct current.** The data sheet lists the LED forward voltage drop at 20 mA to be 1.9 V (instead of 0.6 V for silicon diodes). In addition, do not forget to model the function generator as an ideal voltage supply with a series output impedance of 50 $\Omega$, which is the true output impedance regardless of the "impedance setting" on the function generator. You will want to draw a circuit diagram with all of the components (modeling the output impedance as an extra resistor) and then use Kirchoff's rules to generate an equation that you can solve for $R_S$.

         <!--1.  Reconfigure your voltage amplifier to the transimpedance amplifier circuit shown in Figure @fig:photodetector. Pay attention to the direction of the photodiode. You can use your DMM set to the "diode setting" to determine which side of the diode is the cathode.

You can accomplish this by using the DC offset setting of the function generator. Make sure the oscilloscope shows a square wave that goes from <span class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(8\text{ V}\)</span>.</p></li>
         <li><p>Set up a light emitting diode type HLMP-C625 as the transmitter on a separate small circuit board according to the schematic in Figure <a href="#fig:ocl">8</a>. Be sure to protect the LED with a series resistance that prevents the forward current exceeding <span class="math inline">\(20\text{ mA}\)</span>. <em>Hint:</em> You calculated the required resistance in the prelab. Also, the LEDs have a nominal breakdown voltage of <span class="math inline">\(5\text{ V}\)</span>, which, if exceeded, can damage the LED. Therefore, to prevent this from happening, connect a regular diode in parallel with the LED but with opposite polarity. This will protect the LED from a large negative voltage.</p></li>

         <li><!--Place the LED transmitter close to the photodiode and verify that the photodiode sees the light from the LED.-->
         <p>Configure the LED and photodiode so the tops of them face each other. The LED is directed forward so make sure to orient both the LED and photodiode so they are pointing at each other to maximize the amount of light detected. You can bend the wire leads to get both devices pointed horizontally. You can check the alignment by using a piece of white paper to see if the red illumination is centered on the photodiode.</p></li>
         <li><p>Observe the input driving signal and the output of the receiver on the scope using DC coupling for both signals. Make sure the received signal is due to the red LED, and not from an electrical connection. How did you determine that it was working? You may want to increase the frequency to about <span class="math inline">\(100\text{ Hz}\)</span> to allow the scope to update faster. You can also try switching to AC coupling for the receiver to see if it is easier to see the signal.</p></li>
         <li><p>Determine the frequency limitations of your photometer. We did this in previous labs by measuring the frequency dependence of sine waves to find where the gain dropped by 3 dB. This method is only correct for sine waves. In lab 3, you used a different method for square waves by measuring the RC-time. The capacitor charges or discharges exponentially with a time constant of <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span>. Measure the time it takes for the signal to rise from the base level (room lights) to <span class="math inline">\((1–1/e)\)</span> of the maximum value or to fall from the maximum value to <span class="math inline">\(1/e\)</span> of the difference between the maximum value and the base level. This gives the time constant <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span>. As the 3 dB frequency is <span class="math inline">\(f_B =1/2\pi RC\)</span>, you can determine <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span>. Does this measurement agree with your model predictions? Review your lab 3 prelab if you don’t remember doing this analysis 3 weeks ago.</p></li>
         <li><p>Transfer your LED circuit onto a small breadboard so that you can move the LED relative to the photodiode.</p></li>
         <li><p>Measure the output of the transimpedance amplifier (in Volts) of the transmitted light versus distance from a few cm to about 0.5 meter. How does the background light from the room affect the signal? Explain how you made this measurement. Estimate the the photodiode sensitivity <span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> at the wavelength 625 nm of light emitted by the LED. Plot the power in Watts hitting the photodiode as a function of distance.</p></li>

         <p>The sun has a power output (radiant flux) of <span class="math inline">\(P = 3.85\cdot 10^{26}\text{ W}\)</span> (Watts). Assuming a transparent atmosphere and a <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ m}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(2\text{ m}\)</span> solar panel perpendicular to the sun that absorbs 100% of the light, how much power is received? Consider that the entire <span class="math inline">\(3.85\cdot 10^{26}\text{ W}\)</span> is distributed evenly on a hypothetical sphere with radius <span class="math inline">\(1.50\cdot 10^{11}\text{ m}\)</span> (distance from sun to Earth). Since we know the area of a sphere is <span class="math inline">\(4\pi r^2\)</span>, we can calculate the irradiance or intensity (power per area) as <span class="math inline">\(N = P/4\pi r^2 = 1360\text{ W/m}^2\)</span>. Since the solar panel has an area of <span class="math inline">\(2\text{ m}^2\)</span>, the power delivered to the solar panel is <span class="math inline">\(2720\text{ W}\)</span>.</p>
         <p>There are additional concepts and units that are made necessary by the fact that the eye is not uniformly sensitive to all wavelengths and we are often interested in how humans perceive things. The luminous flux <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is measured in units of lumens (lm) and is basically the same as the power (measured in watts) except that the spectrum of emitted light is weighted by the eye’s response. The conversion from radiant flux (power) in watts to luminous flux in lumens is given by:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[F = y(\lambda)\ P\cdot 683\frac{\text{lm}}{\text{W}}\]</span></p>
         <p>The dimensionless quantity <span class="math inline">\(y(\lambda)\)</span> is the photopic standard luminosity function and is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lum">10</a> and tabulated in the Datasheets section of Canvas. At <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 555 \text{nm}\)</span>, where the eye is most sensitive, <span class="math inline">\(y(\lambda) = 1\)</span>. Therefore, two sources with the same luminous flux will have the same subjective brightness to a human observer (even though the outputted power may be different). This kind of color corrected unit is helpful if you want to design a control panel with lots of colored lights, and you want them all to have the same perceived brightness. We may also be interested in the luminous flux per unit area (similar to intensity). This is measured in units of lux, where <span class="math inline">\(1\text{ lux} = 1\text{ lm/m}^2\)</span>.</p>
