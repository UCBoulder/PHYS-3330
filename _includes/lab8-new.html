         <p>In this lab, you will continue learning how transistors work
         by creating a dual-stage amplifier out of discrete transistors.
         The two stages of the amplifier can each be made from a single
         transistor; one stage will be a common emitter amplifier, and
         the other will be an emitter follower. We will use this as an
         audio amplifier.</p>
         <p>Last week you learned some basics about bipolar junction
         transistors (BJT) and used LTspice to build some basic BJT
         circuits. This week we will get hands on experience with BJTs.
         You will also refine your ability to model and predict the
         behavior of BJTs.</p>

         <p><strong>AC component of a voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(v\)</span> - A voltage <span
         class="math inline">\(V\)</span> which has an AC signal riding
         on a DC offset can be defined as <span
         class="math inline">\(V=v+V_{DC}\)</span>, where <span
         class="math inline">\(v\)</span> defines the amplitude of the
         AC signal and <span class="math inline">\(V_{DC}\)</span> is
         the DC offset.</p>
         <p><strong>NPN</strong> - A BJT where positive current (current
         into the base) pulls current into the collector and out of the
         emitter.</p>
         <p><strong>PNP</strong> - A BJT where a negative current
         (current out of the base) pulls current into the emitter and
         out of the collector. It is simplest to think of a PNP as an
         NPN where all the currents are negative relative to an NPN.</p>
         <p><strong>Base current</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(I_B\)</span> - The amount of current that
         flows into the base. This current controls the BJT.</p>
         <p><strong>Collector current</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> - the current that is
         controlled by the base current.</p>
         <p><strong>Emitter current</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> - The collector current and
         base current combine, such that <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E=I_C+I_B\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Current gain</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> <strong>or</strong> <span
         class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> - The control current
         <span class="math inline">\(I_B\)</span> is related to the
         controlled current <span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> by
         the current gain, such that <span class="math inline">\(I_C =
         h_{FE}I_B\)</span>. This value generally depends on current and
         temperature.</p>
         <p><strong>Base voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_B\)</span> - the voltage at the base
         relative to ground.</p>
         <p><strong>Collector voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_C\)</span> - the voltage at the
         collector relative to ground.</p>
         <p><strong>Emitter voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span> - the voltage at the emitter
         relative to ground.</p>
         <p><strong>Collector-emitter voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{CE}\)</span> - The voltage difference
         between the collector and emitter.</p>
         <p><strong>Base-emitter voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{BE}\)</span> - The voltage difference
         from the base to the emitter; when the transistor is active,
         this will be a diode-like voltage drop (about 0.6 V for
         silicon).</p>
         <p><strong>Coupling capacitor</strong> - A capacitor in series
         with a signal that essentially acts as a short for high
         frequencies and an open circuit for DC. This allows you to
         “couple” a signal into a circuit in a way that DC currents
         can’t flow back into the signal source.</p>
         <p><strong>Decoupling capacitor</strong> - A capacitor between
         a supply voltage and ground. This compensates for a power
         supply’s inductance and acts as a power reservoir. You have
         used these for powering your op-amp circuits.</p>

         id="bipolar-junction-transistors---review"><span
         class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Bipolar Junction
         Transistors - Review</h2>
         <p>You have seen how a BJT is a current amplifier. However
         because currents and voltages are related, it is possible to
         use current amplification to make a voltage amplifier. In this
         experiment we will build a simple two-stage voltage amplifier
         using two BJTs.</p>
         <p>In many practical applications it is easier to use an op-amp
         as a source of gain rather than to build an amplifier from
         discrete transistors. A good understanding of transistor
         fundamentals is nevertheless essential because op-amps are
         built from transistors. We will learn later about digital
         circuits, which are also made from transistors. In addition to
         the importance of transistors as components of op-amps, digital
         circuits, and an enormous variety of other integrated circuits,
         single transistors (usually called “discrete” transistors) are
         used in many applications. They are important as interface
         devices between integrated circuits and sensors, indicators,
         and other devices used to communicate with the outside world.
         High-performance amplifiers operating from DC through microwave
         frequencies use discrete transistor “front-ends” to achieve the
         lowest possible noise. Discrete transistors can also be much
         faster than op-amps; for example, the device we will use this
         week has a gain-bandwidth product of 300 MHz (compared to 5 MHz
         for the LF356 op-amp you have been using).</p>
         <p>As a refresher, the three terminals of a bipolar transistor
         are called the collector, base, and emitter (Figure <span
         class="citation" data-cites="fig:NPN-PNP">@fig:NPN-PNP</span>).
         A small current into the base controls a large current flow
         from the collector to the emitter. This means that the
         transistor acts as a current amplifier with a current gain
         <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> (or <span
         class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>). Moreover, the large
         collector current flow is almost independent of the voltage
         across the transistor from collector to emitter <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{CE}\)</span>. This makes it possible
         to obtain a large amplification of voltage by having the
         collector current flow through a resistor.</p>
         <figure>
         <img src="../resources/lab7fig/bjt.png" id="fig:NPN-PNP"
         style="width:16cm"
         alt="(a) An NPN is the “positive” BJT and (b) a PNP is the “negative” BJT." />
         <figcaption aria-hidden="true">(a) An NPN is the “positive” BJT
         and (b) a PNP is the “negative” BJT.</figcaption>
         </figure>
         <p>From the simplest point of view a bipolar transistor is a
         current amplifier. The current flowing from collector to
         emitter is equal to the base current multiplied by a factor. An
         NPN transistor like the 2N3904 operates with the collector
         voltage at least a few tenths of a volt above the emitter, and
         with a current flowing into the base. There are also PNP
         transistors with opposite polarity voltages and currents. The
         base-emitter junction acts like a forward-biased diode with a
         <span class="math inline">\(0.6\text{ V}\)</span> drop:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_E \approx V_B-0.6\text{
         V}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_{BE} \approx 0.6\text{
         V}\]</span></p>
         <p>Under these conditions, the collector current is
         proportional to the base current:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_C = h_{FE}I_B\]</span></p>
         <p>The constant of proportionality (‘current gain’) is called
         <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> because it is one
         of the "h-parameters", which are a set of numbers that give a
         complete description of the small-signal properties of a
         transistor. It is important to keep in mind that <span
         class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> is not a constant. It
         depends on collector current, and it can vary by 50% or more
         from device to device.</p>
         <p>The emitter current can be determined by current
         conservation:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_E = I_B+I_C =
         I_C\left(\frac{1}{h_{fe}}+1\right)\]</span></p>
         <p>The difference between <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> and <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> is almost never important
         since <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> is normally
         in the range between <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span>
         and <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>, so you can
         generally assume that <span class="math inline">\(I_E =
         I_C\)</span>. Another way to say this is that the base current
         is very small compared to the collector and emitter
         currents.</p>

         <p>The emitter follower (EF) is a very simple BJT circuit that
         just involves a single BJT and a single resistor. This looks
         similar to the switch you designed last week. However, because
         the emitter is not directly grounded, it is not necessary to
         have a base limiting resistor (between <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> and the base); the
         emitter resistor <span class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span> will
         limit the current.</p>
         <p>The fact this circuit is called a follower should clue you
         in to what its function is, which you will solve in the

         <p>In the lab, you will begin by constructing a common emitter
         amplifier (CEA), which operates on the principle of a current
         amplifier. However, a major fault of the common emitter
         amplifier is its high output impedance. This problem can be
         fixed by adding an emitter follower as a second stage. The
         common-emitter amplifier and the emitter follower are two
         common bipolar transistor circuits.</p>
         <p>The common emitter amplifier is similar to the emitter
         follower but with the output at the collector instead of the
         emitter and with a collector resistor <span
         class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>. Again the base-emitter
         voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{BC}\)</span> will be
         <span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span> when active, so
         <span class="math inline">\(V_E = V_\text{in} -
         V_{th}\)</span>, and therefore</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_E =
         \frac{V_\text{in}-V_{th}}{R_E}\]</span></p>
         <p>Since <span class="math inline">\(I_C\approx I_E\)</span>,
         we can then consider this as the current through <span
         class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>, then the voltage drop
         across <span class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span> can be used to
         determine <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{supply}-V_\text{out} =
         I_C R_C \approx I_E R_C\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = V_\text{supply}
         - \frac{R_C}{R_E}(V_\text{in}-V_{th}) \]</span></p>
         <p>This analysis suggests that the output rides on a DC offset
         of <span class="math inline">\((V_\text{supply}+V_{th}
         R_C/R_E)\)</span>. Trying to define the gain as <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}/V_\text{in}\)</span> clearly
         leads to a weird result. It is better to define it in terms of
         only the AC component of the signal.</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G =
         \frac{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}\]</span></p>
         <p>where</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[v_\text{out} =
         -v_\text{in}\frac{R_C}{R_E}\]</span></p>
         <p>so</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G =
         -\frac{R_C}{R_E}\]</span></p>
         <p>Notice how none of this depended on the specific value of
         <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span>. This is a good
         thing because <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> is
         not a constant, so the amplifier can act stable under various
         conditions.</p>

         <p>Your plot in Question <span class="citation"
         data-cites="2.2">@2.2</span> shows that the common emitter
         amplifier is unable to effectively amplify signals that
         oscillate around <span class="math inline">\(0\text{
         V}\)</span> due to the fact that the output signal gets clipped
         at <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}\)</span>. One
         solution to this issue is to ‘bias’ the input of the amplifier
         so that the input oscillates around a DC offset instead of
         around <span class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span>. You
         found above that when the input voltage is less than the
         threshold voltage, <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}=V_\text{supply}\)</span>. We
         can define the <em>quiescent voltage</em> as:</p>
         <p><strong>DEFINITION: Quiescent voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_Q\)</span> - the DC voltage at an
         output terminal with reference to ground when no signal is

         quiescent voltage <span

         clearly is a major issue since the maximum clipping voltage is
         also <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}\)</span>. In
         order to amplify signals that oscillate around zero, the
         quiescent voltage needs to be lowered (to roughly halfway

         <p>A simple way to add a DC voltage and an AC voltage is to
         simply connect them together; however, this can lead to
         currents flowing into the source of the AC voltage (the
         function generator), which can lead to issues (like breaking
         the function generator). To mitigate this, a coupling capacitor
         should be used to couple the AC signal into the circuit. Since
         a capacitor acts as an open circuit to DC currents, the bias
         network will be unable to send a current back into the function
         generator.</p>

         <p>To access just the AC component, you can simply use the AC
         coupling feature on the oscilloscope to remove the quiescent
         voltage from the measurement. However, in order to only send
         the AC component to a load, you will need to use a coupling

         <p>Instead of using the current amplifier model, one can take
         the view that the collector current <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> is controlled by the
         base-emitter voltage <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{BE}\)</span>. For our purposes, the
         Ebers-Moll model modifies our current amplifier model of the
         transistor in only one important way. For small variations
         about the quiescent point, the transistor now acts as if it has
         a small internal resistor, <span
         class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, in series with the emitter.
         The magnitude of the intrinsic emitter resistance, <span
         class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, depends on the collector
         current <span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span>:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[r_e = 25~\Omega

         <p>The presence of the intrinsic emitter resistance, <span

         \frac{R_B}{h_{fe}+1}+r_e~~ \text{(EF)}\]</span></p>
         <p>In addition, this modifies the gain of the common emitter

         <p><span class="math display">\[G =
         \frac{-R_C}{R_E+r_e}\]</span></p>

         using an amplitude that ensures the voltages are less than half
         of the clipping voltage (either positive or negative). You
         should use the 10X scope probe for measuring the output. Does
         your measurement agree with your prediction? Screen shots here

         already has a value suitable for biasing the emitter follower,
         so a direct DC connection can be made between the two circuits.
         Add the emitter follower to your circuit to build the dual

         What is the gain of the full circuit? What is the gain of just
         the emitter follower? Do these measurements agree with your

         class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> resistor to ground after
         <span class="math inline">\(C_{out}\)</span> to keep the DC
         level near ground as the large output capacitor can slowly
         charge up. You may also want to put the scope on AC coupling
