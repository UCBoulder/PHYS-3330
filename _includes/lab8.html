         <p>In this lab, you will continue learning how transistors work
         by creating a dual-stage amplifier out of discrete transistors.
         The two stages of the amplifier can each be made from a single
         transistor; one stage will be a common emitter amplifier, and
         the other will be an emitter follower. We will use this as an
         audio amplifier.</p>
         <p>Last week you learned some basics about bipolar junction
         transistors (BJT) and used LTspice to build some basic BJT
         circuits. This week we will get hands on experience with BJTs.
         You will also refine your ability to model and predict the
         behavior of BJTs.</p>

         on a DC offset can be defined as <span
         class="math inline">\(V=v+V_{DC}\)</span>, where <span
         class="math inline">\(v\)</span> defines the amplitude of the
         AC signal and <span class="math inline">\(V_{DC}\)</span> is
         the DC offset.</p>
         <p><strong>NPN</strong> - A BJT where positive current (current
         into the base) pulls current into the collector and out of the
         emitter.</p>
         <p><strong>PNP</strong> - A BJT where a negative current
         (current out of the base) pulls current into the emitter and
         out of the collector. It is simplest to think of a PNP as an
         NPN where all the currents are negative relative to an NPN.</p>
         <p><strong>Base current</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(I_B\)</span> - The amount of current that
         flows into the base. This current controls the BJT.</p>
         <p><strong>Collector current</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> - the current that is
         controlled by the base current.</p>
         <p><strong>Emitter current</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> - The collector current and
         base current combine, such that <span
         class="math inline">\(I_E=I_C+I_B\)</span>.</p>
         <p><strong>Current gain</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> <strong>or</strong> <span
         class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> - The control current
         <span class="math inline">\(I_B\)</span> is related to the
         controlled current <span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> by
         the current gain, such that <span class="math inline">\(I_C =

         <p><strong>Collector-emitter voltage</strong>: <span

         between the collector and emitter.</p>
         <p><strong>Base-emitter voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{BE}\)</span> - The voltage difference
         from the base to the emitter; when the transistor is active,
         this will be a diode-like voltage drop (about 0.6 V for
         silicon).</p>
         <p><strong>Coupling capacitor</strong> - A capacitor in series
         with a signal that essentially acts as a short for high
         frequencies and an open circuit for DC. This allows you to
         “couple” a signal into a circuit in a way that DC currents
         can’t flow back into the signal source.</p>
         <p><strong>Decoupling capacitor</strong> - A capacitor between
         a supply voltage and ground. This compensates for a power
         supply’s inductance and acts as a power reservoir. You have
         used these for powering your op-amp circuits.</p>

         class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Bipolar Junction
         Transistors - Review</h2>
         <p>You have seen how a BJT is a current amplifier. However
         because currents and voltages are related, it is possible to
         use current amplification to make a voltage amplifier. In this
         experiment we will build a simple two-stage voltage amplifier
         using two BJTs.</p>
         <p>In many practical applications it is easier to use an op-amp
         as a source of gain rather than to build an amplifier from
         discrete transistors. A good understanding of transistor
         fundamentals is nevertheless essential because op-amps are
         built from transistors. We will learn later about digital
         circuits, which are also made from transistors. In addition to
         the importance of transistors as components of op-amps, digital
         circuits, and an enormous variety of other integrated circuits,
         single transistors (usually called “discrete” transistors) are
         used in many applications. They are important as interface
         devices between integrated circuits and sensors, indicators,
         and other devices used to communicate with the outside world.
         High-performance amplifiers operating from DC through microwave
         frequencies use discrete transistor “front-ends” to achieve the
         lowest possible noise. Discrete transistors can also be much
         faster than op-amps; for example, the device we will use this
         week has a gain-bandwidth product of 300 MHz (compared to 5 MHz
         for the LF356 op-amp you have been using).</p>
         <p>As a refresher, the three terminals of a bipolar transistor
         are called the collector, base, and emitter (Figure <a
         href="#fig:NPN-PNP">1</a>). A small current into the base
         controls a large current flow from the collector to the
         emitter. This means that the transistor acts as a current
         amplifier with a current gain <span
         class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> (or <span
         class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>). Moreover, the large
         collector current flow is almost independent of the voltage
         across the transistor from collector to emitter <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{CE}\)</span>. This makes it possible
         to obtain a large amplification of voltage by having the
         collector current flow through a resistor.</p>

         <p>From the simplest point of view a bipolar transistor is a
         current amplifier. The current flowing from collector to
         emitter is equal to the base current multiplied by a factor. An
         NPN transistor like the 2N3904 operates with the collector
         voltage at least a few tenths of a volt above the emitter, and
         with a current flowing into the base. There are also PNP
         transistors with opposite polarity voltages and currents. The
         base-emitter junction acts like a forward-biased diode with a
         forward-voltage drop, where the forward voltage can be modeled
         as the threshold voltage <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span>:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_E \approx
         V_B-V_{th}\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_{BE} \approx
         V_{th}\]</span></p>
         <p>Where <span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span> is about
         <span class="math inline">\(0.6\text{ V}\)</span> for silicon.
         Under these conditions, the collector current is proportional
         to the base current:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_C = h_{FE}I_B\]</span></p>
         <p>The constant of proportionality (‘current gain’) is called
         <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> because it is one
         of the "h-parameters", which are a set of numbers that give a
         complete description of the small-signal properties of a
         transistor. It is important to keep in mind that <span
         class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> is not a constant. It
         depends on collector current, and it can vary by 50% or more
         from device to device.</p>
         <p>The emitter current can be determined by current
         conservation:</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_E = I_B+I_C =
         I_C\left(\frac{1}{h_{fe}}+1\right)\]</span></p>
         <p>The difference between <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> and <span

         <p>The transistor you will use in this lab is the 2N3904, which
         is an NPN. The datasheet can be found in the <a
         href="/PHYS-3330/manuals-data-sheets">Datasheets and Instrument
         Manuals page</a>. Most NPNs have a “complement,” which is a PNP
         with very similar characteristics. The 2N3904’s complement is
         the 2N3906. We have 2N3906s in the lab, but we won’t need them
         in this lab; however, you may want them for your project.</p>
         <p>The 2N3904 and 2N3906 have high current gain <span
         class="math inline">\((h_{FE})\)</span>, however, they are
         unable to deliver large amounts of current. This is fine,
         because the speakers we will use in this are very small and can
         only handle about half a Watt of power. If you want to power a
         larger speaker at higher power (louder), you will need
         transistors that can handle more current: often referred to as
         "power transistors." Power transistors often have much smaller
         current gain than other transistors, and sometimes they must be
         connected as pairs to increase the total gain (you can search
         for "Darlington connection" in Horowitz and Hill). We have a
         complementary pair of power transistors in the lab: 2N2222
         (NPN) and 2N2907 (PNP). These may be useful for a project. It
         is typically easy to distinguish normal BJTs from power BJTs
         since power BJTs have ways of mounting heat-sink hardware to
         help dissipate the heat (a hole for a bolt to go through and a
         metallic surface for good thermal conductivity).</p>

         <p>The emitter follower (EF) is a very simple BJT circuit that
         just involves a single BJT and a single resistor. This looks
         similar to the switch you designed last week. However, because
         the emitter is not directly grounded, it is not necessary to
         have a base limiting resistor (between <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span> and the base); the
         emitter resistor <span class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span> will
         limit the current.</p>

         <p>In the lab, you will begin by constructing a common emitter
         amplifier (CEA), which operates on the principle of a current
         amplifier. However, a major fault of the common emitter
         amplifier is its high output impedance. This problem can be
         fixed by adding an emitter follower as a second stage. The
         common-emitter amplifier and the emitter follower are two
         common bipolar transistor circuits.</p>
         <p>The common emitter amplifier is similar to the emitter
         follower but with the output at the collector instead of the
         emitter and with a collector resistor <span
         class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>. Again the base-emitter
         voltage <span class="math inline">\(V_{BE}\)</span> will be
         <span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span> when active, so
         <span class="math inline">\(V_E = V_\text{in} -
         V_{th}\)</span>, and therefore</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[I_E =
         \frac{V_\text{in}-V_{th}}{R_E}\]</span></p>
         <p>Since <span class="math inline">\(I_C\approx I_E\)</span>,
         we can then consider this as the current through <span
         class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>, then the voltage drop
         across <span class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span> can be used to
         determine <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}\)</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{supply}-V_\text{out} =
         I_C R_C \approx I_E R_C\]</span></p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[V_\text{out} = V_\text{supply}
         - \frac{R_C}{R_E}(V_\text{in}-V_{th}) \]</span></p>
         <p>This analysis suggests that the output rides on a DC offset
         of <span class="math inline">\((V_\text{supply}+V_{th}
         R_C/R_E)\)</span>. Trying to define the gain as <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}/V_\text{in}\)</span> clearly
         leads to a weird result. It is better to define it in terms of
         only the AC component of the signal.</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G =
         \frac{v_\text{out}}{v_\text{in}}\]</span></p>
         <p>where</p>

         <p>so</p>
         <p><span class="math display">\[G =

         <p>Notice how none of this depended on the specific value of
         <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span>. This is a good
         thing because <span class="math inline">\(h_{FE}\)</span> is

         <p>The input impedance of the common emitter amplifier is the

         back at" the collector from the output sees two paths, one
         through the collector resistor <span

         Biasing a Transistor Amplifier</h2>
         <p>Your plot in Question <a href="#2.2">2.3.2</a> shows that
         the common emitter amplifier is unable to effectively amplify
         signals that oscillate around <span
         class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span> due to the fact that
         the output signal gets clipped at <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}\)</span>. One solution to
         this issue is to ‘bias’ the input of the amplifier so that the
         input oscillates around a DC offset instead of around <span
         class="math inline">\(0\text{ V}\)</span>. You found above that
         when the input voltage is less than the threshold voltage,
         <span
         class="math inline">\(V_\text{out}=V_\text{supply}\)</span>. We
         can define the <em>quiescent voltage</em> as:</p>
         <p><strong>DEFINITION: Quiescent voltage</strong>: <span
         class="math inline">\(V_Q\)</span> - the DC voltage at an
         output terminal with reference to ground when no signal is
         applied. <em>Note:</em> quiescent means ‘at rest’.</p>
         <p>So the common emitter amplifier we considered above has a
         quiescent voltage <span
         class="math inline">\(V_Q=V_\text{supply}\)</span>. This
         clearly is a major issue since the maximum clipping voltage is
         also <span class="math inline">\(V_\text{supply}\)</span>. In
         order to amplify signals that oscillate around zero, the
         quiescent voltage needs to be lowered (to roughly halfway
         between the clipping voltages). Consider the circuit below:</p>

         <p>In the next section, we will detail how to connect the input

         <p>A simple way to add a DC voltage and an AC voltage is to
         simply connect them together; however, this can lead to
         currents flowing into the source of the AC voltage (the
         function generator), which can lead to issues (like breaking
         the function generator). To mitigate this, a coupling capacitor
         should be used to couple the AC signal into the circuit. Since
         a capacitor acts as an open circuit to DC currents, the bias
         network will be unable to send a current back into the function
         generator.</p>

         <p>The signal at the base then will be the addition of the DC

         class="math inline">\(V_\text{in}\)</span>. If <span
         class="math inline">\(v_\text{in}\)</span> is the AC component

         <p><em>Note:</em> If <span

         <p>Another issue we haven’t considered, yet, is the fact that

         without disrupting the voltage supplied to the circuit (we
         discussed this in detail for lab 4). The solution is to add a
         decoupling capacitor between the supply voltage and ground.</p>

         <p>Finally, the output of the circuit will oscillate around the

         <p>And finally</p>

         <p><span class="math inline">\(V_Q\)</span>, as we discussed

         <p>To access just the AC component, you can simply use the
         <strong>AC coupling</strong> feature on the oscilloscope to
         remove the quiescent voltage from the measurement. However, in
         order to only send the AC component to a load, you will need to

         Bipolar Transistor</h2>
         <p>We have been considering the current-amplifier model, where
         we use <span class="math inline">\(I_C=h_{FE}I_B\)</span> and
         treat the base-emitter junction like a diode to predict the
         behavior of the circuit. This is a good model, but for some
         applications, treating the transistor as a
         <em>transconductance</em> device is more informative and
         accurate. This is called the Ebers-Moll model, and in this
         model, the collector current <span
         class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> is determined by the
         base-emitter voltage <span
         class="math inline">\(V_{BE}\)</span> (which in reality is
         nearly <span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span>, but
         increases slightly as a function of <span

         <p><span class="math display">\[I_C =
         I_S\bigg(e^{V_{BE}/V_T}-1\bigg)\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(I_S\)</span> is the
         saturation current of the particular transistor (which is
         temperature dependant), <span class="math inline">\(V_T =

         <p>For our purposes, the Ebers-Moll model modifies our
         current-amplifier model of the transistor in only one important
         way. For small variations about the quiescent point, the
         transistor now acts as if it has a small internal resistor,
         <span class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, in series with the
         emitter. The magnitude of the intrinsic emitter resistance,
         <span class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, depends on the

         <p><span class="math display">\[r_e = 25\ \Omega
         \left(\frac{1\text{ mA}}{I_C}\right)\]</span></p>
         <p>The presence of the intrinsic emitter resistance, <span
         class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, modifies the above input
         impedances to:</p>
         <!--removed "reservoir" from in front of (R_e+R_e)-->
         <p><span class="math display">\[R_\text{in} = (R_e + r_e)\
         h_{FE}\]</span></p>
         <p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_e\)</span> is the total
         impedance of the resistors connected between the emitter and
         ground. If this is only the resistor, <span
         class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span>, then <span

         # Prelab

         ## Biasing the transistor 

         1. Explain why we need to have the biasing resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ in Figure @fig:emitterabn if we are going to amplify an AC signal? That is, why won’t Figure @fig:emittera work as is?
         2. Calculate the quiescent voltages (the DC voltages with no signal present) $V_B$, $V_E$, and $V_C$ and the currents $I_E$ and $I_C$ for the common emitter circuit in Figure @fig:emitterabn. You may assume that $h_{fe}$ is so large that the base current is negligible.
         3. How much power is dissipated in the transistor itself? Is the power safely below $P_{max}$? See the 2N3904 data sheet posted on Canvas.
         4. What is the purpose of the input and output coupling capacitors, $C_{in}$ and $C_{out}$?

         ## Common emitter amplifier {#sec:cea}

         1. What is the maximum $h_{fe}$ value at 10 mA collector current? See the 2N3904 data sheet posted on Canvas. (You may use this value for calculations below.)
         2. What is the AC voltage gain of the circuit in Figure @fig:emitterabn for 10 kHz sine waves?
         3. What are the maximum and minimum possible output voltages without the output coupling capacitor in place?
         4. Since the gain is negative, this is an inverting amplifier. Therefore, the maximum output voltage occurs with a small input voltage and the minimum output voltage occurs with a large input voltage. What is the largest input voltage that gives the minimum output voltage and what is the smallest input voltage that gives the maximum output voltage? In this case, you should consider the input coupling capacitor to be in place.
         5. What are the input and output impedances $r_{in}$ and $r_{out}$ at 10 kHz? The input impedance with the bias resistor network in place is the input resistance of the common emitter in parallel with both $R_1$ and $R_2$. That is, $r_{in}$ (total) = $r_{in}$ (common emitter) || $R_1$ || $R_2$.
         6. Calculate the fraction of the original amplitude obtained when a 470 $\Omega$ load is connected to the output via a coupling capacitor ($C_{out}$ in Figure @fig:emitterabn) to ground. HINT: the 470 $\Omega$ resistor is in series with the output impedance of the circuit to ground. The output capacitor only blocks the DC component; it passes the AC signal just fine.

         ## Dual stage amplifier {#sec:dsa}

         1. What is the AC voltage gain for 10 kHz sine waves of the entire dual-stage amplifier (common emitter + emitter follower) shown in Figure @fig:dualsa?
         2. Calculate the quiescent voltages (the DC voltages with no signal present) $V_B$, $V_E$, and $V_C$ as well as the currents $I_E$ and $I_C$ for the emitter follower part of the circuit in Figure @fig:dualsa. You may assume that $h_{fe}$ is so large that the base current is negligible.
         3. How much power is dissipated in the transistor of the emitter follower? Is the power safely below $P_{max}$? See 2N3904 data sheet posted on Canvas. What if we connected an 8 $\Omega$ speaker to $V_{out}$ without using the $C_{out}$ coupling capacitor? This basically changes $R_E$ to 8 $\Omega$. How much power would be dissipated in the emitter follower transistor in that case? Is that safe to do?
         4. For the entire dual stage amplifier in Figure @fig:dualsa, what is the output impedance $r_{out}$ at 10 kHz? You should use the Eber-Molls model. Also, the impedance at the base of the emitter follower is simply the collector resistor of the common emitter amplifier.
         5. Calculate the fraction of the original amplitude obtained when a 470 $\Omega$ load is connected to the output via a coupling capacitor ($C_{out}$ in Figure @fig:dualsa). HINT: the 470 $\Omega$ resistor will be in series with the output impedance of the circuit to ground. Even at only 10 kHz, the output capacitor acts as a wire for the AC impedance. It serves to block only the DC voltage.

         ## Audio amplifier

         1. A standard non-amplified speaker has an input impedance of 8 $\Omega$. If your computer headphone jack had an output voltage at 1 V unloaded and an output impedance of 8 $\Omega$, what would the loaded voltage be if you hooked it up to the 8 $\Omega$ speaker? HINT: Think voltage divider
         2. Now, instead you can use the common emitter to amplify the signal from the computer first. If your common emitter amplifier has an unloaded output voltage of 2.7 V (assuming a gain of 2.7), what is the output voltage if you connect an 8 $\Omega$ speaker to the amplifier? HINT: Think voltage divider with the output impedance of the common emitter.
         3. Finally, consider using the two-stage amplifier shown in Figure @fig:dualsa to drive the speaker. If the emitter follower amplifier output stage has an unloaded output voltage of 2.7 V (assuming a gain of 2.7), what is the output voltage if you connect an 8 $\Omega$ speaker to the amplifier? Note that in the lab you will be using the output of the lab’s laptop computer headphone jack. HINT: Think voltage divider with the output impedance of the emitter follower.
