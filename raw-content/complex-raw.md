Note: This review uses $j=\sqrt{-1}$. Similarly, the lab guides (and generally elsewhere in electronics), use $j$ instead of $i$ in order to prevent confusion with the convention of using $i$ for current.

# Complex Numbers

A complex number is written as:

$$z = x + jy$$,

where $x$ is the **real** part of $z$ ($x=Re(z)$), and $y$ is the **imaginary **part of $z$, ($y=Im(z)$). Both $x$ and $y$ are **REAL** numbers. 

## Arithmetic with complex numbers

If we have two complex numbers, $z_1$ and $z_2$, where:

$$z_1 = x_1+jy_1$$

$$z_2 = x_2+jy_2$$

then;

$$\text{Addition: }z_1 + z_2 = (x_1 + x_2) + j(y_1 + y_2)$$

$$\text{Subtraction: }z_1 - z_2 = (x_1 - x_2) + j(y_1 - y_2)$$

$$\text{Multiplication: }z_1 z_2 = (x_1x_2 - y_1y_2) + j(x_1y_2 + x_2y_2)$$

$$\text{Division: } \frac{z_1}{z_2} = \frac{(x_1x_2 + y_1y_2) + j(x_2y_1-x_1y_2)}{x_2^2+y_2^2}$$
