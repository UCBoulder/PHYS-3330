# Goals
<!--
*** Decided to just remove most of this opening dialog to comply with the feedback
-->
Today you will learn to use equipment that are useful for building and testing electronic circuits. You will use all of these instruments extensively throughout the semester.

-   Power supply
    -   This is used to provide DC power to your circuits
    -   It can be used as a voltage source (constant voltage) or a current source (constant current)
    
-   Function generator
    -   This is used to create signals with various waveforms
    -   This is an incredibly useful tool for characterizing, testing, and prototyping circuits

-   Digital multimeter (DMM)
    -   This is an extremely versitile tool that can measure DC and AC voltages and currents, resistances, and sometimes more (depending on the model)
    -   It has a simple display that can only show single values such as a root-mean-square voltage of an AC signal.

-   Oscilliscope
    -   This is a voltage meter that can "plot" voltage over time.
    -   This is a far more powerful tool for characterizing voltages than the DMM because you can characterize wave shapes and noise

<!--
*** added "further" to imply continuation. some other minor edits 
-->
In this course you will further develop essential laboratory skills. Not only is the above equipment found in nearly every lab space, but you will practice keeping a lab notebook in a practical way and practice a model based approach to experimental design.

<!-- 
*** had difficulty parsing the feedback for this part, but I think I improved it
-->
In this course, you will practice implementing models, testing those models, and refining them when necessary. Extremely accurate and nuanced models are often difficult to implement because they rely on more complicated and difficult to solve mathematics. Balancing accuracy and simplicity is a skill and takes practice.

Today, you will learn how to

-   Tie (connect) your circuit to *Earth ground*,

-   Set up the power supply so that you can get positive and negative voltages (relative to ground),

-   Operate the power supply in constant voltage and constant current modes,

-   Measure physical properties, such as voltages current, and resistance,

-   Trigger the oscilliscope,

-   Operate the function generator,

<!--
*** added this 
-->
-   Use a micrometer to measure the diameter of a wire and estimate the resistivity,

-   Measure resistors using 2-terminal and with 4-terminal measurement methods,

-   Develop familiarity with the model-based approach to experiment.


# Lab Notebook Guidelines

Lab notebooks are an essential tool in research and development settings. They may seem tedious to maintain, but if you develop good habits now, you will avoid unecessary headaches in the future. Poor notetaking can force you to unecessarily repeat experiments and/or calculations.

In this course, the lab notebook will play an essential role and it will be graded each week.  You will use your notebook for keeping records of many things including:

-   Answering prelab questions from the lab guide to prepare you for upcoming lab activities,

-   Answering in-lab questions,

-   Measurements and data,

-   Plots, diagrams, pictures, and sketches,

-   Experimental procedures and designs,

-   Analyses and results.

The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade because learning to keep a good lab notebook is crucial for your professional development. Keeping a physical notebook is very common, but many people like to keep digital notebooks nowadays. There are many popular tools; since the University now uses a Microsoft ecosystem, OneNote ends up being very convenient for integrating with other Microsoft tools such as Teams and OneDrive. Jupyter notebooks are another useful tool as they can integrate Python code which can streamline your calculations and allow for nice and easy plots. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your processes and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analyses via Canvas in scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.

<!--You may find it helpful to write up many of your notes on the computer, for example, within Mathematica, Jupyter Notebooks. This is fine. However, before your notebook is turned in, the notes, plots, and analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by printing and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder. This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook is the main mechanism for communicating your process and results of the lab experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.-->

# Cables and Adapters

![**Banana cables** - wires with banana connectors at the end. The power supply and DMM have banana sockets to make connections to.](../resources/lab1fig/banana.jpg){#fig:banana width="8cm"}

![**Coaxial (coax) cables** - this kind of cable is specially designed for sending signals through. It has two conductors: one is the inner conductor which is used to send the signal through, and the other is the outer conductor which is designed to be grounded. Gauss's law suggests this geometry will shield the inner conductor from external EM fields.](../resources/lab1fig/coax.png){#fig:coax width="10cm"}

![**BNC plug connector** - there are many kinds of connectors used for coax cables. BNC is a large, robust, and popular connector.](../resources/lab1fig/bnc-plug.jpg){#fig:bnc width="10cm"}

![**Mini-Grabber to BNC Socket Connector** - this allows you to make connections to exposed wires. The red grabber is connected to the inner conductor and the black grabber is connected to the outer conductor.](../resources/lab1fig/mini-grabber-to-bnc.png){#fig:grabber width="10cm"}

![**BNC to double banana adapter** - this adapter allows you to connect coax cables to the DMM or power supply. The *"ground" tab* (labeled GND) lets you know which banana plug gets connected to the outer conductor of the coax. Well designed devices have banana sockets spaced just far enough for these adapters to fit.](<../resources/lab1fig/bnc banana adapter.png>){#fig:banana-to-coax width="10cm"}

# Some Useful Definitions

**Common ground** - there are many types of ground and people often confuse them and use the word "ground" to refer to any one of them. A common ground is any part of a circuit which is (arbitrarily) referred to as $0\text{ V}$ and that all other voltages are measured with respect to.

**Earth ground** - a common ground which is ultimately connected to the Earth. The 3<sup>rd</sup> prong on wall outlets is Earth ground. Under buildings large metal plates are buried and are connected to via a *ground wire*. Earth ground allows for certain kinds of short circuit failures (and lightning strikes) to have the power diverted away and avoid excessive damage to devices, buildings, and people.

**Chassis ground** - a common ground which is a metal frame around the circuit. If a device plugs into the wall with 3 prongs, it *should* have the chassis connect to **Earth ground**. Chassis grounding can help fascilitate the safety of Earth grounding, but also acts a Faraday cage, shielding the circuit from external EM waves.

**Electrical Load** - a load refers to the impedance (in ohms) connected to the output of a power source. This could be a speaker, a light bulb, a microwave oven, or anything else which is drawing power from the circuit.
[//]: # (a load refers to the impedance (in ohms) connected from the output of a power source to the circuit's ground.)

**RMS (Root Mean Square)** - the square root of the average of a periodic function squared over one period $V_\text{RMS}=\sqrt{\langle V(t)^{2}\rangle}$. Example: For the function $V(t) = V_0\sin(\omega t)$, the RMS value is $V_\text{RMS} = \large\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}$.

*Note:* $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\approx 0.707$. This number will come up **a lot** in this course, and is worth committing to memory!

# Lab Activities

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* In this course's lab manuals, "ground" refers to Earth ground; other kinds of ground will be explictly differentiated.

## Power Supply

Your DC power supply will provide your circuits with the required power. Setting up the power supply will almost always be the first thing you do when you begin working with a circuit. The Keysight EDU36311A DC Power Supply has **three** outputs that can be independently controlled. Pages 43-45 of the User Guide (which can be found in the [Data Sheets and Instrument Manuals page](/PHYS-3330/manuals-data-sheets)) discuss this in detail.

### Set up the DC voltage bias

We want two of the power supply channels to be set up such that the potential difference (voltage) set on one of the channels is ***<span style="color: red;">positive</span>*** **with respect to ground** and the other is ***<span style="color: blue;">negative</span>*** **with respect to ground**. 

By default, all 3 outputs are ***FLOATING*** with respect to ground. You have to manually connect one of the terminals of an output to ground in order to "tie" it to ground. This gives you the flexibility to use the power supply in a number of different ways.

When you set $5\text{ V}$ on channel 2, the power supply will make the $(+)$ terminal $5\text{ V}$ above the $(-)$ terminal. In order to get $5\text{ V}$ **relative to ground**, you will need to connect one of these terminals to the ground terminal.

1.  Get some <span style="color: green;">green</span> wire from the wire spool rack on the top of the blue tool cabinet to make these grounding connections. Connect channel 2's $(-)$ terminal to ground and channel 3's $(+)$ terminal to ground (see the green lines drawn on Figure @fig:ps). You can unscrew the input jacks on the power supply to expose a small hole where the jumper wires can be inserted.
<!--

*** I hadn't considered this in detail, but now that you mention it: for single phase AC, hot is black, neutral is white, and ground is green. For DC red is positive, and black is negative: which I believe implies just 2 voltages. Since we use 3 voltages DC, I think the best way to comply with other standards would be for

Green - Ground

White - Neutral

Red - DC above ground

Black - DC below ground

*** This way, Red and Black which are both considered "HOT" in some standard, are both considered "hot", and green is considered "cold".

*** The distinction between neutral and ground being that, even though they are the same voltage, the ground wire is not connected to a load. In this way, making green connections from the ground port to the + and - ports of the outputs and a white wire from the power supply to the bread board would probably be the most "compliant" with safety standards. 

[//]: # (We harp on that black is ground in this course - I'm not certain why that was historically done here and I'm certainly on board to converting to conventional standards (including shifting red to white and blue to black {I might have that backwords}). But, we should change all the proto board connections to be consistent? Buy a bunch of green banana cables? I'm genuinely in favor of this and it will require revisions to subsequent lab guides.)
-->

2. We will set the outputs of channel 2 and 3 to $15\text{ V}$. Predict what the voltages will be at each of the 4 output terminals (whenever someone refers to a voltage at a location, they always mean "relative to ground").

3. Using banana cables, how would you connect your DMM to the power supply to measure the voltage at these terminals? Sketch it in your notebook (*Hint:* don't use the minigrabbers since there's no sensible place to grab with them).

4.  Set the voltages and turn on the outputs of channels 2 and 3. Set up your DMM to measure the voltages at each terminal. Do your results match your predictions?

![Keysight EDU36311A DC power supply connections](../resources/lab1fig/EDU36311A.png){#fig:ps width="20cm"}

### Investigate operating modes

**Ohm's Law** states the voltage drop across a load is

$$\Delta V = IR$$

But as the load $R$ changes, either the voltage or the current will have to adjust. A *voltage source* supplies a *constant voltage* (the current changes), and a *current source supplies a *constant current* (the voltage changes). Mathematically:

-   Voltage source: $I(R) = \frac{V}{R}$, where $V$ is a constant.

-   Current source: $V(R) = IR$, where $I$ is a constant.

The power supply can be used either as a voltage or current source. When it is a voltage source, it will display **CV** for *constant voltage* in the top right corner of the channel's display, and when it is a current source, it will display **CC** for *constant current*. The power supply will automatically switch between these modes depending on the voltage and current limits you set as well as the load attached.

1.  With no load attached, what mode is the channel in (CV or CC)? How can you quantify the value of the load $R$?
<!--
*** The point of this problem is to get them to think of the load as infinity. I think it's fine if they're confused by the question as long as they ask for help.

[//]: # (Can we expound here? It's not clear to me what exactly you're looking for.)
-->

2.  Try adjusting the value of the voltage limit and the current limit. Why is the current output always zero?

3.  Use a banana cable to short the $(+)$ rail of Channel 2 to ground. What mode is the channel in now? Use Ohm's law to determine the load on this output. Why does the voltage output not reach the voltage limit?

4.  Vary the value of the voltage limit and current limit again. Describe the behavior of the voltage and current readings and the mode (CV/CC) of the power supply. What happens when you short the output to ground (have too small a load)? What is the maximum output of current and voltage your supply can produce?

5.  Given a known load of $50\ \Omega$, describe how you would set the voltage and current limits to get CV mode with $15\text{ V}$ or CC mode with $300\text{ mA}$ (this is a good place to check in with an instructor).


## The Oscilloscope (Scope)

The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an oscilloscope (aka scope or o-scope) to make voltage measurements over time. Old, analog scopes scanned an electron beam horizontally across fluorescent screen, and applying a voltage at the input would cause the beam to deflect up and down with the voltage, allowing you to visualize how the voltage behaved over time. Today, most labs are equipped with digital oscilliscopes which rapidly measure the voltage and then plot the data on a screen in real time. This has many advantages over using the DMM as a voltmeter because it gives you much more information about the voltage you're measuring.

There are a few precautions to observe when operating the oscilloscope:

-   Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block ventilation of the interior.

-   Do not apply more than 300 V to any input terminal.

-   Avoid serious or fatal injury from electrical shock. Do not remove the case to expose the 120 V mains.

Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged by wrong settings. So, try whatever you're curious about and measure and document what happens.

![Basic operation guide for the oscilliscope.](../resources/lab1fig/scope-guide.png){#fig:scope-guide}

The front panel of the scope is organized in a very particular way:

-   Vertical refers to controlling the y-axis of the plot (which is voltage).
    -   These scopes have 4 separate inputs which can all be used at the same time, and have individual controls for scaling and offsetting the voltages of each.

-   Horizontal refers to controlling the x-axis of the plot (which is time).
    -   All 4 channels have to be displayed with the same time scale, so there is only one set of horizontal controls for all 4 channels.

-   The black buttons allow you to select options displayed next to them on the screen.

-   Knobs can be pressed like buttons (read the labels to see what they do).

### Setting up the Scope

<!--The Tektronix TBS 2000 Series has four independent channels so that four separate signals can be displayed at once. Each trace is color coded with the buttons on the panel, and you can open a menu specific for each channel with the rectangular, colored, numbered buttons in the vertical control area.-->

![The Default Setup button resets the scope to all of the default settings. This is a great way to clear the previous users settings. *Note:* the default is to report the signal as 10x greater than measured (this is to compensate for the scope-probes which attenuate the signal by 10x).](../resources/lab1fig/scope-default.png){#fig:scope-default-setup}

1.  Turn on the scope and once it's booted up, press the **Default Setup** button to reset all the user settings. The default setting is to have the reported voltages be 10x what is actually measured (we'll get to why this is the default later).

2.  Press the yellow 1 button to open channel 1's menu, and set the *Probe Setup* setting to 1x (see Figure @fig:probe-setup). Repeat this for the other 3 menus.

3.  Turn off channels 2, 3 and 4. To turn a channel off (so you don't see it on the screen), you can press the menu button for that channel to open the menu, and then again to disable the channel.

![Set *Probe Setup* to 1x.](../resources/lab1fig/channel-menu.jpg){#fig:probe-setup}

### Measuring a DC voltage on a scope

1.  Use a BNC cable and a BNC to double banana adapter to connect channel 1 of the scope to the power supply. <!--Measure the voltage on scope using the cursors. Try exploring the different knobs and menus on the scope to make the measurement. Refer to the appendix listed at the end of this document if you get stuck.-->

2.  Apply a voltage from your power supply and confirm that this is what you see on the oscilliscope. The yellow triangle on the left of the screen indicates where $0\text{ V}$ is (this can be moved with the yellow vertical postion knob). *Hint:* moving the zero position to the bottom of the screen allows you to choose a smaller voltage scale (zooming in) so that you have more resolution on the screen.
    1.   Try to estimate the voltage by counting the number of divisions and using the reported vertical scale (voltage / division) in the bottom left of the screen (see Figure @fig:scope-screen).
    2.   Try using the cursors option in the **Navigation** portion of the controls.
    3.   Press the **Measure** button in the **Resources** portion of the controls to open a menu of data processing options. Which one of these options would be best to use?

***IMPORTANT NOTES:*** 

-   Even though this button is called "measure," the real measurement is already being done to display the line on the screen.

-   The scope stores the real measurements of voltage and time in an internal log.

-   "Measure" allows you to analyze the stored data by applying computations to report certain values.

-   It is important to read the details of an option before using it because it may not do what you think it does.

<!--
*** good call, I meant to put it back in somehow, but forgot
-->
-   Oscilloscopes can only distinguish about 100 different values on the vertical axes of the screen. Before you use the "Measure" button, make sure that the trace covers at least half the screen vertically without clipping at the top or bottom. This way you get a resolution/accuracy of approximately ±2%.

3.  In your lab notebook, describe the setup of the electric circuits (diagrams are useful) and the outcomes measured.

![The oscilliscope screen.](../resources/lab1fig/scope-screen.png){#fig:scope-screen}


## Creating an AC waveform using a function generator and measuring it on a scope

The Keysight EDU33212A function generator can produce a number of different waveforms over the frequencies from $10^{-6}\text{ Hz}$ to $20\text{ MHz}$. The output amplitude can be varied between $1\text{ mV}$ and $20\text{ V}$ peak-to-peak with an output impedance of $50\ \Omega$.

<span style="color: red;">There is one main **precaution** to keep in mind: ***Do not connect any output of the EDU33212A directly to DC power*** or to the output of any other instrument or circuit. Doing so will burn out the output amplifier!</span> In a later labs, we'll learn how to use different tools to allow you to safely interface the function generator with DC power.

1.  The function generator has an output impedance of $50\ \Omega$, and it assumes, by default, that you will use a $50\ \Omega$ load. This means that half of the voltage will drop across the output impedance, and half will drop across the load, so by default, the function generator displays only half the voltage that it is actually trying to apply (becuase this is how much "reaches" the load). <span style="color: red;">**Every time you turn on the function generator, you have to set the output termination setting to High-Z**</span> so that it displays the full voltage (see the appendix or page 53 of the user manual).

2.  On Channel 1, create a $1\text{ V}_\text{pp}$ (volts peak-to-peak) sine wave at 1 kHz with no DC offset, and turn the output **on**.<!-- (you may want to use this standard setup in the future if you have trouble).-->

## Triggering

In order to view waves on the oscilliscope, it needs to redraw the wave in the right place at the right time. "Triggering" is the process of stabilizing a repeating signal on the screen.

1.  Use a BNC connector to connect the output of the function generator to the input of channel 1 on the scope.

2.  Set the *voltage / div* and *time / div* so that the sine wave appears nice and big on the screen. Remember that the period is the inverse of the frequency. Always consider the frequency you are using and adjust the scope's horizontal scale appropriately to avoid aliasing! Talk with an instructor to learn more about aliasing.

3.  The **Trigger** options are in the top-right corner of the front panel. Open the *Trigger Menu*. You should see that the Channel the scope is triggering on is Channel 1.

4.  There are 3 options that you will change most regularly. Paraphrase these in your lab notebook for future reference.

    -   **Trigger channel:** the input that the scope uses to trigger (this setting can be changed by pressing the vertical-scale knob corresponding to the channel you want to trigger to).

    -   **Trigger level:** the scope knows to trigger the wave when the voltage changes through the trigger level voltage (this setting can be changed with the *Level* knob below the *Trigger Menu* button).

    -   **Slope:** selects whether to trigger when the voltage rises to the trigger level (rising edge), or falls to the trigger level (falling edge).

    -   **Trigger mode:** of the modes, there are 2 you will mostly use for this class:

        1. **Auto (untriggered roll)**: This setting is needed to measure DC voltages that don't pass through a trigger level. It does a poor job of triggering on slower waves (less than a few hundred $\text{Hz}$).

        2. **Normal:** If no trigger even occurs, nothing will be displayed (so measuring DC can't be done). But this setting allows you to trigger on slower waves.

5.  Change the trigger channel. Since there is nothing to trigger on on other channels, you will see that the wave no longer displays in a measurable way (this is what "untriggered" looks like). Describe what you see. Change the trigger channel back to Channel 1.

6.  Play with the trigger level. Describe what you see. Why does this happen? Get help if you don't understand.

7.  Press the slope button to change between rising and falling edge triggering. Desribe what happens (*Hint:* the wave is **not** "flipping").

8.  Set the trigger level to $-400\text{ mV}$. Is the wave still triggered? If not, increase the trigger level until it is.

9.  On the function generator, change the amplitude to $100\text{ mV}_\text{pp}$. The waveform should no longer be triggered. Why?

10. It is annoying to have to adjust the trigger every time you adjust your waveform. To accomodate this, the function generator has an output specifically for triggering on: **Sync / Trigger out** (just to the left of the Channel 1 output).

    - Use a coax cable to connect this output to Channel 4 of the scope.

    - Turn on Channel 4 on the scope.
    
    - Adjust the vertical scale to fully view the waveform. A good habit is to have the wave occupy roughly 75% of the screen vertically.

    - Describe the waveshape.

11. Change the trigger channel to Channel 4. Adjust the trigger level. Does the trigger level matter? Why?

12. Play with the waveform (from channel 1) on the function generator. What happens to the **Sync / Trigger out** when you change the

    - the amplitude,

    - the frequency,
    
    - the DC offset,

    - the phase offset,

    - the wave shape?

14. Why do you think the **Sync / Trigger out** is a square wave?

## Measuring Waves with the Scope

1.  Make a waveform of your choice with the function generator. Measure the period, frequency and peak-to-peak amplitude

    -   by estimating using the divisions,

    -   using the cursors,

    -   using the *Measure* button. ***Be careful to read how the result is calculated in the bottom-left corner of the screen to make sure you're choosing the right option!***

2.  Repeat with a sine-wave.

## Measuring Quantities with the Digital Multimeter

**The multimeter is a useful device to make quick and easy measurements of all sorts of things.**

1.  The first thing you'll notice is the dial on the on the DMM. This allows you to select what kind of measurement you'd like to make. There is also a yellow button which allows you to cycle through different measurement settings on each of these dial positions. What is the difference between the voltage channel with the straight line over the $\~{\text{V}}$ and the squiggly line over over the $\overline{\text{V}}$?

2.  The second thing you'll notice is the single **COM** port and separte ports for current measurements and for everything else (voltage, resistance, etc.). Why would there be separate ports for current?

<!--To measure various quantities with the DMM, you must set the dial on the DMM to the correct setting that you want to measure. The Fluke 115 DMM that is in your toolbox at your workbench has three banana jack input ports at the bottom. Based on the quantity that you want to measure (voltage, current, resistance, etc.), you need to be sure that you've installed the leads into the appropriate input ports (NOTE: one of the leads will always be connected to the **COM** port).-->

3.  Connect the leads and set the dial to measure resistance (the mini grabbers are great for this). Get three $5\text{ k} \Omega$ (5%) resistors from the stock drawers. Measure the resistance of each resistor. Do all the resistors meet the 5% specification?

4.  Measure the voltage across the resistor. Why is it $0\text{ V}$?

5.  Connect the resistor to the power supply and set the output to $10\text{ V}$. Use the DMM to measure the voltage across the resistor. Does the DMM agree with the display on power supply? Sketch a circuit diagram representing the arrangment of the supply, resistor, and DMM.

<!-- 
*** I was thinking of letting them flounder a bit here. The "correct" way I had in mind would be with the mini-grabbers. I think letting them try to be creative so that they can be told why it's a bad idea to jerry-rig connections.

[//]: # (How do you intend them to do this? Should we provide some direction given they'll have no clue where to start?)
-->

6.  Switch the DMM to the $\~V$ mode. What does the voltage read now? Does this meet your expectation?

7.  To measure the current you will have to rearrange the circuit and change the DMM configuration. Set up the DMM properly so that current flows *through* the correct port of the DMM. Does the current measurement match the display on the power supply? Sketch a circuit diagram representing the arrangment of the supply, resistor, and DMM.
<!--
*** Not sure! I am open to ideas. I think having some ambiguity here is fine, as I expect everyone should be getting through this part during the 3 hours.

[//]: # (Same as above, do we instruct them?)
-->

8.  Switch the DMM to the $\~A$ mode. What does the current read now? Does this meet your expectation?

<!-- 
*** I have been working across a few computers and sometimes it seems to not sync. I don't remember what I did, so I will take another stab at it!


9.  Now take the output from the function generator and measure the AC voltage with the DMM.
[//]: # (maybe combine with next step? This feels offputting - not sure.)

4.  The DMM also has an AC voltage setting. You will need to use the function generator to produce an AC (sine) waveform. Over what frequency range is the reading accurate to 2%?  Note: the DMM displays the RMS amplitude of the waveform. See Definitions at the beginning of the guide for an explanation of RMS. You will also need to consider how [“Amplitude” and “Peak-to-Peak”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) are related.

5.  Remember in the future that this is the usable frequency range for the AC setting of the multimeter. Record this frequency in your lab notebook for future reference.

9.  It should be clear by now that, on the DMM, ~ is a symbol for AC and -- <!-- should render as a long dash --> is a symbol for DC. Use the $\~V$ mode to measure the AC voltage from the function generator. Set the function generator to $2\text{ V}_\text{pp}$ at $1\text{ kHz}$. Note: the DMM displays the RMS amplitude of the waveform. See Definitions at the beginning of the guide for an explanation of RMS. You will also need to consider how [“Amplitude” and “Peak-to-Peak”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) are related. Is the measurement from the DMM consistent with your expectation?

## Measuring Small Resistances (4-Terminal Measurement)

In the previous section, you measured resistances using the ohmmeter in the DMM. You will now use all the measurement techniques and devices you have learned about to determine the most accurate way to measure a small resistance. A 4-terminal measurement is a method of measuring small resistances in a way that "ignores" lead resistance and contact resistance.

###  Measure a small resistance using a DMM ohmmeter

1.  Use a ~$2\text{ m}$ length of magnet wire as your small resistor (this can be found on the wire spool rack on top of the blue tool cabinet next to the entrance of the lab - there should also be a 2m stick near the tool cabinet). Magnet wire has a very thin amber-colored insulating coating (about 0.001" in thickness). Make sure you remove the insulation from the ends of the wire to make a good electrical connection and measurement of the diameter of the wire. You can burn off the insulation with a flame or use sand paper to scratch it off.

2.  Calculate the resistance based on the diameter, length, and resistivity (the resistivity, $\rho$, of copper at room temperature is $1.68\text{ μ}\Omega$-$\text{cm}$)? Remember that $R = \rho L/a$, where $L$ is length and $a$ is area. You'll find dial calipers and a micrometer in the "Measuring Tools" drawer of the blue tool cabinet. The spool of magnet wire should be 28-gauge. Look up a copper magnet wire gauge chart online and confirm that your diameter measurement agrees with what you find.

3.  Use the ohmmeter in the DMM to measure the resistance of the wire. **Document your setup, measurements, and calculations in your lab notebook.**

### Measure a small resistance using a 4-terminal approach

The way the DMM makes a resistance measurement is by delivering a very small, calibrated, current to the resistor, and then it measures the voltage drop across it's internal resistor (in parallel with your resistor) and calculates $R$ based on Ohm's law. The issue here is that the voltage doesn't just drop across the resistor, but also the contacts and all the leads. This is called a 2-terminal measurement because you are using the same 2 terminals to supply the current and measure the voltage. You will now make a more accurate measurement using a 4-terminal measurement.

1.  Use your DC power supply in CC mode to deliver a specified current. Connect this to the resistor. You now have 2 terminals connected to your resistor.

2.  Use your DMM to make a voltage measurement of the voltage drop across just the resistor (this adds another 2 terminals connected to your resistor).

3.  Using the current reading on the power supply and the voltage reading on the DMM, use Ohm's law to determine the resistance of the resistor.

4.  Draw a diagram of your experimental set up in your lab notebook.

5.  Consider how the amount of current flowing through your resistor affects the sensitivity and accuracy of your measurement (consider precision of your measurement devices as well as heat/temperature dependances).

### Compare the two measurement techniques

1.  The ohmmeter in the DMM works by supplying a calibrated current and measuring the potential difference between the outputs. How is this measurement different than the 4-terminal approach you built?

*Hint:* consider where the current is flowing and what resistances are involved with each measurement technique. It is usually helpful to draw a diagram including all the resistances (including the wires and the contacts).

2.  Which method is more accurate for measuring small resistances based on your explanation above?

3.  Do your two measurements confirm the scientific argument you just made? Defend your assertion using your data.

**To change the horizontal (time base) scale:**

1.  Horizontal scale knob changes the time per division

2.  Horizontal position knob changes location of the trigger (labeled as a orange arrow on the top of the screen)

![Horizontal settings are for adjusting time scale and offset](../resources/lab1fig/horizontal-scope.png)

**To change the vertical (voltage base) scale:**

1.  Vertical scale knob changes the voltage per division

2.  Vertical position knob changes location of the ground (labeled as a colored-coded arrow on the left of the screen)

![Vertical settings are for adjusting voltage scale and offset.](../resources/lab1fig/vertical-scope.png)

**To access the parameters for each channel:**

The channel buttons open the corresponding channel menu with the following options:

1.  Input Coupling (AC/DC/Ground)

    - This should **ALMOST ALWAYS** be set to DC! AC coupling removes DC offsets, which can be convenient if you know what you're doing with it.

2.  Invert Signal (this should be left off)

3.  Probe Setup

    - This setting multiplies the measured voltage by the amount specified. In most cases, this should be set to 1x.

If a channel menu is open, pressing the channel button again will turn off that channel's trace.

![The channel buttons can be used to turn on/off channel traces and open channel menus.](../resources/lab1fig/vertical-scope2.png)

**To adjust the trigger:**

1.  Trigger knob changes the voltage level of the trigger

2.  Trigger MENU button

    - Select which channel to trigger off of (trigger level arrow changes color to show which channel is being triggered). You can also change the trigger channel by pressing the vertical scale knobs like buttons.

    - Slope: can trigger off a rising or falling edge.

    - Trigger Mode:
      
        - Auto: (will display a "roll" of measurements when not triggered). This setting will cause the wave to crawl across the screen at low frequencies.
        
        - Normal: (won't update the display if not triggered). This setting will not allow you to display DC without an external trigger source.

3. The "Force Trigger" button should be avoided. If you're having trouble triggering, this button often won't help, and it will stunt your growth with regards to learning how to use the scope properly!

![The triggering options can all be found on the top-right of the front panel.](../resources/lab1fig/trigger-scope.png)

![The bottom right of the screen shows what channel the scope is triggering on as well as the trigger level and the rate at which the trigger is occuring.](../resources/lab1fig/scope-screen-trigger.png)

**To select the AQUIRE mode:**

1.  Run/Stop: sets the scope to continuously aquire or freeze after last trigger. The button will glow red when "stopped" and green when "running."

2.  Single: (aka single shot) aquires a single trace from the trigger and then doesn't continue to update.

![These buttons are used to set how the scope should update.](../resources/lab1fig/scope-top-bar.png)

**Measure Menu (top of panel):**

You can select various operations to perform on the measurements on various channels. *Be very careful* with these because they can be very deceptive and may not give the result you are expecting, and how you display the wave on the screen greatly affects the number that "Measure" will report. Generally use cursors to make accurate measurements. 

**Cursor Menu (under Navigation):**

1.  Choose time (vertical bars) or voltage (horizontal bars) measurement.

2.  Choose which channel to measure (measurement cursors are the same color as the channel they are measuring). You can change the channel by pressing the numbered channel button.

3.  Big top knob moves the cursors. You can press "Fine" to make it move more smoothly (this will also cause other knobs to move more smoothly which can be very annoying).

4.  Press the knob like a button to switch cursors.

5.  Position relative to ground (trigger zero time) is displayed on the screen with the T symbol.

6.  Relative distance between cursors is displayed on the screen with the $\Delta$ symbol.
